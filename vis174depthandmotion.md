# Depth and Motion

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvLk0OjY5aM)

upon deciding what I wanted to do in this particular sketch, as well as what I wanted to do in the class as a whole, I think I wanted to make a bunch of short, comedic sketches, incorporating the theme of the week but also getting these sketches out. first, I want to do this because it forces my 1-2 minutes to be sort of cohesive --- its easy to make something fragmented or incomplete upon the guise of experimentation and the constraints of 1-2 minutes, so forcing it to be a  comedic sketch in a sense forces it to be complete. second its also important for my own aspirations -- having a channel of comedic sketches seems extremely useful for my portfolio.

visually, I think I was inspired by this comedy sketches by Paige Weldon and Finn Straley in terms of what they put their effort in. They're quite funny sketches and look quite nice but are not necessarily super cleanly done, with obvious mishaps with sound and camerwork. In a sense, I wanted my sketches to be in the middle between the roughness of vines/youtube videos/other dumb sketches but not quite as polished as the professional sketch comedy shows such as Key and Peele (not that I could make them that polished if I wanted to!) Thus, I bought this T6i camera which seemed like the perfect camera for this; it had all the capacities of the dslr, being definitively elevated over any phone camera, while not being so beautiful as the rental 6EOS cameras at the media lab, which I think might even be too clean for the aesthetic I'm going for.

The sketch i came up with was relatively simple, just the idea of a new amazon "same second delivery" where a dude actually comes to your house to hang out, and hands you your package when you click place order. it escalates as the amazon delivery guy cooks food in the dudes own home. I think the punchline manifests itself because people just think its a dumb video where once someone clicks order a person arrives at their door instantly; instead, the guy arrives before he clicks order and casually makes himself at home, sitting next to him, and then handing him the package once he clicks order. 

With the framework of something comedic, the prompt of depth and motion was perhaps slightly hamfisted --- a bit shoved in. I used a 50 mm lense which very effectively conveyed stark contrasts of foreground and background, but for something comedic and simple perhaps it wasn't the most appropriate style to use. I atttempted to do motion in the quick cuts between the kitchen and the computer, but in retrospect I'm not sure it quite came across.

Visually, I think most of the shots were relatively adequate. I think the camerawork was quiet but it fit in for the style I wanted. The slowness of my character opening the door when arriving and putting up my jacket I think effectively heightens the joke, although I am unsure whether the long ending works quite as well. 

The strangest part overall was the sound. The entire thing is awfully silent. while I dont think music would feel appropriate, i wish i just had more things happening just to give a little more of a real sound environment. 

Overall, I think the joke came across and visually it was good, although I think the last joke doesn't hit quite as hard to be justified for the extra minute of the video. Perhaps cutting it after the first joke would be better if I was just uploading this to youtube for my own use, but I think for this class that extra minute had the necessary visual elements to fit the prompt.
