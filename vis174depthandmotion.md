# Depth and Motion

upon deciding what I wanted to do in this particular sketch, as well as what I wanted to do in the class as a whole, I think I wanted to make a bunch of short, comedic sketches, incorporating the theme of the week but also getting these sketches out. first, I want to do this because it forces my 1-2 minutes to be sort of cohesive --- its easy to make something fragmented or incomplete upon the guise of experimentation and the constraints of 1-2 minutes, so forcing it to be a  comedic sketch in a sense forces it to be complete. second its also important for my own aspirations -- having a channel of comedic sketches seems extremely useful for my portfolio.

The sketch i came up with was relatively simple, just the idea of a new amazon "same second dellivery" where a dude actually comes to your house to hang out, and hands you your package when you click place order. it escalates as the amazon delivery guy cooks food in the dudes own home.

With the framework of something comedic, the prompt of depth and motion was perhaps slightly hamfisted --- a bit shoved in. I used a 50 mm lense which very effectively conveyed stark contrasts of foreground and background, but for something comedic and simple perhaps it wasn't the most appropriate style to use. I atttempted to do motion in the quick cuts between the kitchen and the computer, but in retrospect I'm not sure it quite came across.

The other part that was a bit strange was the sound. The entire thing is awfully silent. while I dont think music would feel appropriate, i wish i just had more things happening just to give a little more of a real sound environment.
