upon deciding what I wanted to do in this particular sketch, as well as what I wanted to do in the class as a whole, I think I wanted to make a bunch of short, comedic sketches, incorporating the theme of the week but also getting these sketches out. first, I want to do this because it forces my 1-2 minutes to be sort of cohesive --- its easy to make something fragmented or incomplete upon the guise of experimentation and the constraints of 1-2 minutes, so forcing it to be a  comedic sketch in a sense forces it to be complete. second its also important for my own aspirations -- having a channel of comedic sketches seems extremely useful for my portfolio in a sense.
