# Post Production

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcDD1rFkl58)

This project was very exciting for me because I frequently had ideas on different post-production effects I wanted to do in a sketch. I think pretty immediately I knew I wanted to do something with cloning myself --- it was relatively simple but I had an idea of how to morph it into a sketch.

The conceit was parodying the typical time travel trope of being like 'Under any circumstances do NOT talk to yourself or interact with yourself.' However, in my video, instead avoiding or hiding from yourself, I wanted it to instead be awkward. From then on, I tossed in a secondary part of the clone not doing his dishes to give it a bit of finality.

Regarding the feeling part, I kinda didn't think too hard about it, since all my videos pretty clearly attempted to evoke some sort of laughter or humorous feeling. I also think the post-production was successful in escalating the awkwardness idea; I'm happy with both MEs looking at our phones at the same time. 

I also wish I was able to get away from my house in shooting. IN this class almost every sketch took place at my home, but I think with the time constraints and lack of a car, getting an adequate location was tough. Furthermore, I think it was simply a bit easier to write for my house, since sketches are generally focusing on the ordinary and the banal, and its hard to come up with something funny that already includes an exotic location.

Overall, I was happy with the video. I think the end part was weaker than the beginning part, and I wish the vlogy part was more stylelized, but I think I enjoyed the joke in this video a lot. 

I mostly address the technical aspects of cloning myself in a separate post.
