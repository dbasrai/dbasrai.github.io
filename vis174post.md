# Post Production

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcDD1rFkl58)

This project was very exciting for me because I frequently had ideas on different post-production effects I wanted to do in a sketch. I think pretty immediately I knew I wanted to do something with cloning myself --- it was relatively simple but I had an idea of how to morph it into a sketch.

The conceit was parodying the typical time travel trope of being like 'Under any circumstances do NOT talk to yourself or interact with yourself.' However, in my video, instead avoiding or hiding from yourself, I wanted it to instead be awkward. From then on, I tossed in a secondary part of the clone not doing his dishes to give it a bit of finality.
