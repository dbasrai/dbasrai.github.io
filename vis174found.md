This prompt in particular was extremely difficult for me, especially since I was attempting to make every one of my sketches to be not only funny, but funny in a way that is 'written.' (as in, the writing is what's funny, not random occurances or strange acting on screen that gets people to laugh).

I had this idea of parodying the way bro-ey people watched Superbowls, and wanted to subsitute the superbowl with older footage. However, to be honest, I don't think I really did something that adequately used the prompt or the footage itself. I realized I needed to change either the audio or the video, but I just ended up chopping the audio in a way that didn't add anything to the film. I think I kinda hamfistedly took the prompt and shoved it into an idea I had, instead of really coming up with an idea that made good use of archival footage.

This is the first project I got a lighting kit, and it really gave me a lot of flexibility but I ended up not quite using it as well as I should have. It looked good in camera but in the editing I didn't quite realize how brightly I was lit, how many shadows there were, and how the light felt distinctly blue. I think I just needed to adjust some settings in teh camera, but it was exciting finally working with adequate lighting equipment. 

Overall, I wish I spent some more time coming up with a good idea, and perhaps focused more on the editnig than with shooting something. I felt like it was only after I watched the class's videos that I came up with some good stuff --- if I were to do it again, I think I'd love to put together an actual sketch using only archival footage, as in, write an entire sketch, and use characters in the archival footages to say the lines and cut it together.
