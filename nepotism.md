I'm working my first job and I don't make crazy money. I know that because I was on one of those like hourly wage to annual salary converters. And if you're ever on one of the converters, you're not making crazy money. no one's ever had to do their hourly wage times.

40 times 52 and had six figures come out the end. That's never happened. Okay. Actually, my salary, it's mostly the fluorine, the 52 doing the heavy lifting. My salary is pretty close to 40 times 52. 

Now, I like that's a thing though. I mean it's not just all racism. It's like It's the biggest issues in nepotism to me just like racism happens to me about every six months but nepotism has then constant harm to my life all the time So I was hard for me to find a job.

It was really hard. I I submitted hundreds of applications. I remember once I seminated like an application and within 15 minutes, I got a redemption letter. It said we're sorry inform you but we were looking for a candidate who skills are more suited for the role. In question. I know how bad it feels identified from a job for being unqualified when you're already lying about your qualifications.

But not gonna arrangement was even true. That's like even the version. We had two HDPA points, three extra years of industry experience and is it disabled? Protected veteran, Even dad. He was unqualified. We came by Costco Greener, But in that's the theme, like, it's hard because because this rich parents give their kids jobs.

I think, I think that's It never quite set in until recently that like, just an epism just like, kind of so prevalent around. All right, one of my buddies. He I said, so, on searching for John my buddies, they share a college, gets a software. Assist figure software, engineering job at Dell.

And here's the thing. His name is Zachary Dell. I don't think that's a coincidence. Same with my other buddy, he got assisted remedia job, his name is Johnny. Barstow Sports stuff. No. It's and that's looking like I'm very progressive. I think Jeff Beza basil is like he's a bad person, but but here's the thing, like I just think it's a hard sell to be like this guy who like is innovator and all this stuff doesn't deserve his money.

I think the real issue is a Preston Bezos. His crappy son, I google Jeff Bezos kids and Preston Bezos came up and he's a Princeton student who has his own engineering company already. So I found his Instagram, he just a person, you can just find his Instagram and and I bully him Because we're not gonna get to Jim Bezos, and we're not gonna have income inequality start.

We're not gonna get to him, We're not gonna tell him to start paying Amazon workers. Well, we can do is be mean to Preston Bezos. That's how you go home is like, Jeff. We need to, we need to start paying people properly. Here's a public Instagram. Go, I go on there and he puts pictures with all his friends and I just say they're all unattractive.

I post that. I Dmm two girls, one cup just every day up. It's like And I'll be present. Anything can run like I'm saying be ashamed. I think that's the way you may change. It's the bully people's kids like the guys in the bad guys didn't taken. They have the right idea.

You don't go after taking, You don't have to take in kids. They knew what they were doing. We need to go and hit billionaire's kids. That's the that's a takeaway from all this.

Now, man, it's I don't think pressing based anything wrong. That's the thing. It's like it. Like if you have a rich parent, doesn't make you a bad person. I only have to be ashamed of it, but if you have rich parents, I think you should disclose it. Like when you walk in a rooms and stuff Because there's people enriched parents here among us talking to us.

Hey, look like real people. Sending us. Very request and ship.
