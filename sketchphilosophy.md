As I went about making the sketches for this class, and as I've went about thinking of future ideas for sketches, I came up with some soft rules which I think made my sketches somewhat unique and streamlined.

1) The premise should be a joke

I think it gets pretty tempting when writing sketches to come up with a vague, kinda absurd premise and just try and wing it from there. I think popular sketch shows like key and peele wrote a little more along these lines. However, I realized my best work was when I come up with a structured, visual joke with a clear setup and punchline, then wrote around it.

2) Use MYSELF somewhere in the video

Usually, I always like casting people and not being in my film, but I realized to make a sketch series interesting, the characters have to be familiar. People also tend to like it when there's one person they can follow, and can be judgmental when new people come into future videos. 

3) Don't end on the punchline, end on an awkward reaction to the punchline

Its pretty popular for sketches to immediately cut after the final joke, but this has always felt a bit abrupt for me. I love having a laugh, and somewhat a strange reaction to the situation be the final shot. It gives it a bit of an arc, a visual fade-out of sorts. 

4) Keep the shots as simple as possible

I realized in my depth and focus shot that even basic filmmaking technique like focus changes and extreme closeups feel awkward in sketches. Sketches are about simplicity, about simple jokes, and complexities in the film process many times detract from these.
