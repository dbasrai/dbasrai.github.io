# Anatomy of a Local Scene

Most nights, in any city worth visiting, a comedians are performing, some paid, many not, across a variety of venues from coffee shops to comedy clubs. A city's comedy scene, made up of local comedians and held together by the open mics and shows where they perform, forms the bedrock of a comedians years (fix). 

If you want to do stand-up comedy, with few exceptions you must be a responsible citizen of your local city's scene. Here, we'll briefly give an overview of what a scene usually looks like and how to become part of it. We'll chat about what it means to "move up" in a scene, usually the necessary precursor before doing stand-up professionally. Also, perhaps in a segment applicable only to larger comedy cities (NY, LA, Chicago, Boston, etc.), we'll talk about finding your pocket of the scene, engaging specifically with the shows and people who appeal to your comedic sensibilities.
