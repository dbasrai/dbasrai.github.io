# Anatomy of a Local Scene

Most nights, in any city worth visiting, a comedians are performing, some paid, many not, across a variety of venues from coffee shops to comedy clubs. A city's comedy scene, made up of local comedians and held together by the open mics and shows where they perform, forms the bedrock of a comedians years (fix). 

If you want to do stand-up comedy, with few exceptions you must be a responsible citizen of your local city's scene. Here, we'll briefly give an overview of what a scene usually looks like and how to become part of it. We'll chat about what it means to "move up" in a scene, usually the necessary precursor before doing stand-up professionally. Also, perhaps in a segment applicable only to larger comedy cities (NY, LA, Chicago, Boston, etc.), we'll talk about finding your pocket of the scene, engaging specifically with the shows and people who appeal to your comedic sensibilities. 

## The Open Mic

One of the comedy's biggest paradoxes is how important open mics are relative to how much time you lose doing them. Most open mics you do somewhere between 3-5 minutes of stand-up, for a frequently uninterested crowd of another comedians, and have to wait around anywhere from 1-3 hours. I think most people understand performing is helpful, but this is far too inefficient, right?

I think the important part of open mics is over those several hours you are surrounded by other comedians trying to imrpove. The natural conversations, making rleationships, hearing people trying to be funny are crucial to getting better. The sets you see as you prepare are crucial to getting better. Getting the nerves, panic, despair before you go up are essential to getting better. Hearing jokes out of a microphone, even if the crowd is dead is crucial to getting better.

As you progress, I think the open mic becomes a little more inefficient to do super frequently.l If you have nothing better to do...

## Showcases

Most cities big enought o support local comics who live there host showcases. These are booked shows where a handful of comics do shorter sets, usually somewhere between 8-10 minutes. There can be a wide range of quality based on the venue, time ,attendance, etc.. but these end up being usually your first real shows. 

Showcases are so fucking fun. So so fun.

## Opening

Opening for another seasoned comedian is also. something i've hapendt. reaching out ot the comedian directly is actually not forwned up, but usually some reason to reach out is better. Even doing a show for them berforwe, you do'nt have to be fast friends, et.c
