# You'll Get Em Next Time

If following the class faithfully, this week will be your first time performing stand-up. If all goes well, this lesson will be useless and you have my permission to spend the week gloating. However, and perhaps more likely, if it doesn't go as well as you fantasized about, this is the lesson for you.

In this lesson, we'll talk a little about bombing. Bombing, or not getting laughs, is an inevitable part of doing stand-up. In fact, nothing is more important in stand-up than bombing. It is an absolutely fundamental skill to know IF you bombed, and know how to try and not bomb next time. 

## Record Audio (and not video!)

In order to know what did well and what bombed, you need to be able to listen back to your set without the adrenaline of being on stage. It is essential to **record audio of your set**, that way you can listen back later on to evaluate and revise.

Any voice memo app on your phone works great. Put it on the stool (and not in your pocket) to get clear audio. I use an app that auto-transcribes --- this can potentially be useful.

I'd actually recommend against recording video early on. Its annoying to set-up, and you generally want to be mostly focusing on your set before you go up.

## Try To Watch Other Sets

It's tempting to prepare the entire time you go up, but I'd try sitting back and watching other sets. For one, "bombing" is always in the context of how good the room is. Getting light laughter in a completely silent room might be considered killing. The opposite is true in a hot, easy crowd. You can only really gauge a room by watching other comics.

## Don't Hide the Bomb

There's a lot of tips and tricks to make a bad set seem less bad. These include talking through silence, jumping into the next joke when a punchline doesn't hit, being loud, etc.. My suggestion would be to pause you'd normally do for laughter, and if there isn't, take a breath, then continue on to the next joke.

### No Need to Address It

This is probably controvserial, but I don't think you should acknowledge a joke not hitting, at least at this stage. At the open mic level, most jokes aren't hitting, so it isn't the same elephant in the room as it is when bombing in front of a great show.

I think there's little tricks that can get nervous laughter during the bomb, but I'm not sure its really necessary. Again, I'd generally recommend letting the joke miss, take a breath, then continue on. 


## Bomb BECAUSE it wasn't funny

Bombing is part of stand-up, but you should bomb because a joke wasn't funny. A lot of new comics bomb for other reasons that don't really teach them much... usually due to being ill-prepared for their set.

Here's a couple ways to bomb that have nothing to do with how funny you are, and how to avoid them.

### Forgetting/messing up jokes

Every comic messes up jokes and forgets lines/words to a certain extent, but you can greatly lower the percentage of this happening with preparation. Feel no qualms about bringing up a setlist/notebook/index card on stage if it helps ensure you don't forget jokes. I would highly suggest using written materials on paper instead of your phone --- I've seen so many comedians flounder around with screen locks on stage. I also don't think too much about "professionality," but I think most people agree it just looks a little nicer when its paper being glanced at instead of a phone. 

Definitely reading too much off notes can hurt your delivery, but I think early on erring on the side of nailing what you written matters more. Over time, weaning off reliance on notes is probably useful, but I think its much more important not to forget lines early on. 

### Can They Hear And Understand You?

The funniest joke will bomb if they can't hear you or understand you. Before your set, listen to the sound system when other comics are performing. Muddy, reverby sound is common of bars with shitty sound systems... these require you to talk exceptionally slow and clearly. Listen back to your set after to ensure you can understand yourself. 

## Assignments

Congratz on doing your first set! Here's a few assignments based on listening back to the audio

### For those who like answering Qs

Listen back to your set, and answer the following questions.

1) How did the set feel overall? Do you think it went well, or did it bomb, or somewhere in the middle.

2) Which jokes worked.

3) Which jokes didn't work.

4) Do you notice any obvious things that make you hard to understand? Talking too fast, talking too quiet, missing words?

### For those who like rote work.

Transcribe your set word for word.

### For those who are more verbal

Listen to your set, and pause at various times that make sense, and riff to yourself alternate ways to phrase set-ups/punchlines/etc..
