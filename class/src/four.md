# Don't Address It

If following the class faithfully, this will be your first time performing stand-up. There's a common hack first time stand-up comedy joke many converge to: "This is my first time doing stand-up, it's a lot like my first time having sex..." and then insert pretty much anything you want. 

It never really works, and I'd suggest, much like losing your virginity, its probably worth not addressing that its your first time doing stand-up. For most of us (including me), the moment you start performing it'll be quite obvious you're new to this. There's no need to beat this to the ground with explanations that it's your first time doing stand-up.

In this (short) lesson, we'll emphasize that there's not too much that's important outside of just taking the leap and going up. I'll give a few suggestions, but other than that, enjoy it!  

## Prepare Till You're Comfortable

You should prepare enough such that you can go up and tell jokes. For me, I usually know the main beats of jokes, and usually jot down a setlist that includes those beats. 

If you're prone to forgetting when nervous, I'd jot down a more expansive setlist. For practicality, bringing up something along the size of a notebook or an index card makes sense. I'd generally suggest using paper over phone. 

## Record Audio (And Not Video!)

You should record the audio of your set. Any voice memo app on your phone works great. I use an app that auto-transcribes --- this can potentially be useful.

I'd actually recommend against recording video early on. Its annoying to set-up, and you generally want to be mostly focusing on your set before you go up.

## Try To Watch Others

It's tempting to prepare the entire time you go up, but I'd try sitting back and watching other sets. I'd sort of suggest mostly tuning out only when you're the next set.

## Have Fun!

Have fun!

## Don't Acknowledge Bombing

It's your first time, most likely it'll go badly. It'll get better and less painful. I'd avoid any pithy lines that acknowledge that it's not going well. End your joke, enjoy the silence, move on to your next joke.

## Assignments

Congratz on doing your first set! Here's a few assignments based on listening back to the audio

### For those who like answering Qs

Listen back to your set, and answer the following questions.

1) How did the set feel overall? Do you think it went well, or did it bomb, or somewhere in the middle.

2) Which jokes worked.

3) Which jokes didn't work.

4) Do you notice any obvious things that make you hard to understand? Talking too fast, talking too quiet, missing words?

### For those who like rote work.

Transcribe your set word for word.
