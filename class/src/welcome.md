# Welcome!

Hi, my name is Diya Basrai, I'm a Chicago-based comic. This is the online "textbook" accompanying the stand-up 101 course I'm teaching at Revival Theater. While the in-person course is best suited for someone who has never performed stand-up before and has ~$300, this textbook is a compilation of my thoughts, examples, and opinions accompanying each lesson that is hopefully interesting to comics of all levels. 

# Layout

The numbered weeks correspond to each week's class in an 8-week class. The Basics page contains useful advice for new comics, such as terminology and guides for entering a scene. The Chicago Resources page contains useful links for Chicago comics.
