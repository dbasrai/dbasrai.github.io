# Welcome!

Hi, my name is Diya Basrai, I'm a Chicago-based comic. This is the online "textbook" accompanying the stand-up 101 course I'm teaching at Revival Theater. The course is best suited for someone who has never performed stand-up before, but perhaps could be useful for those who are experienced but untalented. 

Overall, this textbook covers the material, in-class exercises, and at-home assignments given during the in-person course. While mainly useful for those taking the course, I have some hope there are some interesting ideas for any comic who stumbles across this link. I've also tried to add a little practical advice on how to navigate the local scene, some suggestions universal and others specific to Chicago. 

# Layout

The numbered weeks correspond to each week's class in an 8-week class. The Basics page contains useful advice for new comics, such as terminology and guides for entering a scene. The Chicago Resources page contains useful links for Chicago comics.
