# Purpose

The purpose of this class is to build a 5-minute set, which is the ticket to perform at any open mic. The class is comprised of 8 lessons that will provide ideas and exercises to guide crafting these 5 minutes. The first 4 lessons are built around generating the intial 5 minutes, and the last 4 lessons are built around performing it and refining it. 

In practicality, I think nothing in this book will be as useful as sitting down a weekend, banging out ~5 minutes of jokes, then going to an open mic and performing it. But I realize performing is intimidating, so hopefully the next few lessons will give something to grasp at to get the confidence to start hitting the mics. But the minute you feel like you'd survive, get out there!
