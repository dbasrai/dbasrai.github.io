# Move the Mic Stand Out of the Way

Early on in your career, audiences are looking for any excuse to stop listening. Sometimes, not moving the mic stand out of the way before starting your first joke is enough for people to think you're an amateur. Stand-up is hard enough... and looking like you know what you're doing is necessary to even have a chance of getting laughs.

This week we'll be covering some absolute fundamentals. First, we'll chat a little about set structure, that is, how to order your jokes. Then, we'll talk about some basics of performing stand-up for those who never have been on stage before. 

## Set Structure

### Start strong, end on time

A comedy adage I've heard is to always end your set with your best joke, deemed "the closer." However, when starting out, you're frequently working with really short set times. Furthermore, one of the few things that matters early on in stand-up is not "running the light," or going past your alotted time. So instead, I suggest starting with your best joke, and ending with a joke that ensures you end on time.

### You Don't Need Transitions Between Jokes

In most forms of writing, clean, flowing transitions between ideas is at the core of good writing. This does not apply to stand-up. Finishing a joke, pausing, and then starting your next joke is a perfectly fine segue 99% of the time.

Roy Wood Jr. finishes off a 3 min political joke, and then hops into a joke about street fighter... and the only transition he does is a little pause.

### Cohesion in logic, not necessarily subject matter

The jokes that make-up your set do not need to fit together. You can talk about farts and politics in the same set. However, your "worldview" does have to be cohesive... it is jarring when your attitude in one joke is contradicted in a future joke. If you set-up your fart joke by saying that you're a dumb guy and don't like to have hot takes, it'll feel odd if you then transition into some hard hitting political jokes. 

Generally, set cohesion is something that emerges naturally from the jokes you write --- in general, I wouldn't even think about this too much. If you're writing about things you care about (see Lesson 1), a cohesive worldview will naturally be shared among all the jokes. 

This clip isn't really that representative of this, but been looking for an excuse to share some Martin Urbano:

## Some guidelines for ordering your jokes

If cohesion doesn't matter to much, how do you order your set? Here's a couple tips.

### Open strong

Repeating myself, but I'd generally start with your funniest joke first.

### Open punchy

Early on, the audience isn't sure if you're funny, and has less patience for long set-ups. Open with "punchy" jokes, or jokes that have fewer words before it gets to the laugh. The longer your first set-up, the more the audience gets worried they're listening to someone rambling. 

### Open Clean

Do you have dirty stuff? The audience will tolerate it more if they trust you. Win them over early with cleaner stuff, and use that goodwill to get to your grosser stuff.

### Address assumptions up top

You don't have to address everything, but if you want to, doing it when you start usually makes sense. Here's a nice first joke that flows nicely out of being introduced.

### Close with a laugh

I've emphasized previously that jokes should end with laughs. This is especially important on your final joke.

## Performance Basics

Okay, you've written a set. You should now go and perform it, and you'll learn more than anything I can ever describe here. For the nervous and neurotic, here's a write-up of a few basics you should follow. 

### Move the mic stand out of the way 

I'd suggest most people take the mic out of the mic stand, it lets you move around and doesn't block your body. When you do so, move the mic stand out of the way so it doesn't obstruct the view.

### Say hi! 

Don't rush your first joke. I like to say hello when I get on stage. Others like to ask how the audience is doing. If you don't want to, take a few moments of silence before you start. Jumping into your first joke can make you look nervous.

### Don't acknowledge when a joke doesn't work

I've mostly tried to avoid giving hard rules, especially with things that are subjective. This is one of the few things that I'd strongly suggest. If a joke doesn't do well, don't address it. Pause, breath, and say your next joke.

### The Light?

The host will shine a light at you when you have one minute (or sometimes two minutes) left in your set. First, don't go over. Second, acknowledge the light with a head nod, that way, the host doesn't think you missed it and repeatedly flash the light at you. Third, don't go over.  

### Put the mic back

If you took the mic and moved the mic stand, put it back how it was originally before you leave.

### Say bye!

When you finish, say goodbye. If you had a good set, remind them what your name was.

## In-Class Assignments

1) I always suggest a little ritual as you get on stage, and doing the same thing each set. It doesn't have to be funny, just has to reflect YOU! Come up with one.

2) Choose an opening joke. Practice pretending to be introduced, and launching into it.
