# Start Strong, End on Time

A comedy adage I've heard is to always end your set with your best joke, deemed "the closer." However, when starting out, you're frequently working with really short set times. Furthermore, one of the few things that matters early on in stand-up is not "running the light," or going past your alotted time. So instead, I suggest starting with your best joke, and ending with a joke that ensures you end on time.

In this lesson, we cover two topics: set structure and performance basics. Set structure gives suggestions for ordering your jokes into a set... and most of what I'll be emphasizing is that you really don't have to think about this structure too much. I'll also make sure to cover some of the absolute basics behind *performing* stand-up comedy, how to hold a mic, how to stand, how to finish your set, etc.. 

## You Don't Need Transitions Between Jokes

In most forms of writing, clean, flowing transitions between ideas is at the core of good writing. This does not apply to stand-up. Finishing a joke, pausing, and then starting your next joke is a perfectly fine segue 99% of the time. 

Roy Wood Jr. finishes off a 3 min political joke, and then hops into a joke about street fighter... and the only transition he does is a little pause.

## Cohesion in logic and persona

The jokes that make-up your set do not need to fit together. You can talk about farts and politics in the same set. However, your "worldview" does have to be cohesive... it is jarring when your attitude in one joke is contradicted in a future joke. If you set-up your fart joke by saying that you're a dumb guy and don't like to have hot takes, it'll feel odd if you then transition into some hard hitting political jokes. 

Generally, set cohesion is something that emerges naturally from the jokes you write --- in general, I wouldn't even think about this too much. If you're writing about things you care about (see Lesson 1), a cohesive worldview will naturally be shared among all the jokes. 

## Tips for Ordering your Set

If cohesion doesn't matter to much, how do you order your set? Here's a couple tips.

### Open strong

I'd generally start with your funniest joke first.

### Open punchy

Early on, the audience isn't sure if you're funny, and has less patience for long set-ups. Open with "punchy" jokes, or jokes that have fewer words before it gets to the laugh

### Cleaner stuff earlier

Do you have dirty stuff? The audience will tolerate it more if they trust you. Win them over early with cleaner stuff, and use that goodwill to get to your grosser stuff.
