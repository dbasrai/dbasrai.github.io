# The Grammar of Comedy

Set-up, Punchline, Tag... this is the grammar of stand-up comedy. In the same way every sentence is just some variations of subject, verb, object (or something like this maybe), most jokes can distilled down to the above structure.

A punchline is where the laugh is supposed to happen.

The set-up is everything that comes before the punchline. 

A tag is extra laugh lines that build on the punchline. 

Most jokes go set-up, punchline, and an optional tag... I wouldn't worry too much about great jokes that don't fit this structure. At least for this lesson, and likely for the first few years of your career, I think its useful for every single joke to adhere this structure. 

Violating this structure takes both an equal amount of mastery and goodwill by an audience, neither of which you likely have when starting.

Lets explore this structure by looking at a few types of jokes that fit quite nicely into this structure. 

## The Misdirect

To me, the bread and butter joke is the misdirect. These jokes fit very nicely into the set-up, punchline, tag structure. The set-up creates an expectation. The punchline violates it. A better explanation is just to watch this Dan Mintz joke.

Key to hard misdirect jokes are simple set-ups... these sometimes are beginning of stories, phrases, starts of conversations that you maybe have heard in your life already... you already know, or think you know, where the next sentence is going. This allows the violation of that expectation, or the punchline, to work. 

Mintz, along with other one liner comics (check out Zach Reinert for a modern take on this) relies on "hard" misdirects, which I'm using to refer to punchlines that can be fantastical and non-realistic, just anything that catches the audience off guard. 

Watch Laurie Kilmartin for a masterclass on a more conversational style approach to this type of joke. A lot of her jokes in this set fit very nicely into the misdirect class, and its quite easy to identify the set-up, punchline, tag structure, but the jokes are generally in service of a larger story.

### The Rule of 3s

An oft-referenced format in stand-up, but nonetheless I would say effective. After any set-up, the comic lists 3 things. The first two creates a pattern, the last one subverts it.

## "Apply the Same Logic" joke

A little bit of a mouthful, but this "logic" joke is another very popular structure of joke that fits nicely into the setup/punchline/tag structure. 

The set-up is usually in two parts. The first one is an anecdote, or a news article they read, or just any situation. The second part breaks down the logic that led to the cause and effect in that situation. The punchline then "applies the same logic" to something else. 

Todd Barry I think is the master of these types of jokes. Apologies for the captions on this clip.

Perhaps another way of illustrating this type of joke is this great Jon Dore bit both using this type of joke and somewhat poking fun of it.

These jokes tend to be elevated when the anecdote feels somewhat ordinary, but actually sounding out the logic behind what happens reveals something strange. Sometimes these jokes fall flat because if the "logic" behind the original anecdote is already obvious, or already clearly flawed, then going through it feels pedestrian. 

### The Analogy

The analogy is a concise subset of this type of a joke, and is a variation of the same structure. 

The first part of the set-up is an initial anecdote or situation. However, instead of a second part that plainly spells out some logic, the second part of the set-up isnow an analogy, an alternate situation the comedian asserts is similar to the initial anecdote. In this type of joke, the punchline then is explaining the logic that is similar between the two situations. 

Again, this is better explained through example.

</a>

The initial situation is asking a 20-something guy to put a condom on. The analogy, or another situation that Taylor says is similar, is a kid putting a halloween costume on. Note this gets a laugh --- in certain applications of this type of joke, the analogy is both the set-up and the punchline, if the logic that binds the two situations is immediately apparent. However, for the most part, there is a punchline right after the analogy that explains why they're similar (spells out the logic that is similar between the two situations). Here, Taylor's act-out of the kid clearly explains why these are similar.

Another example...

## Some basics

We've gotten the sense of the structure behind jokes, lets be concrete about a few basic principles.

### Put the punchline at the end of the sentence

You want to pause when the audience is supposed to laugh. Thus, once you say the funny part, you don't want to step over the laughs while finishing the sentence. Put the funny part at the end of the sentence.

### Telegraph the punchline

The funny part should be obvious and quick. Unless this is your exact style, I'd avoid subtle jokes and slow burns.

### Trim unecesssary set-up

Every part of the set-up should be necessary for the punchline to work. Feel free to embellish to get to the point faster. "The other day" is much quicker than "4 years ago when I turned 22"

### Avoid explanation

Avoid having to explain what something is. If your joke references something very sppecific, can you substitute it with general that everyone alreayd knows? If you need to explain what something is, you probably need a laugh in the explanation to justify it.

### Cut lukewarm tags

Tags should add on to a punchline. Generally keep a tag if it gets a laugh comparable to the punchline. If a tag gets a much smaller laugh, it's probably not worth it. Tags can sometimespretty much restate the punchline, and that's okay if the punchline can justify an extra line to really wring the crowd. But generally, tags should build on the idea of the punchline, not just rephrase it. 

## In-class Exercises

1) Identify in a joke you wrote the set-up, punchline, tags. Is there any part that doesn't seem to fit this description, and if so, is it necessary for the joke? Is there anytime the traditional ordering of set-up-\>punchline-\>tag doesn't quite fit in your joke, and if so, should it be rearranged? 

2) Take the set-up in your joke... and write a new punchline. If possible, use the classes of jokes described above. If a new punchline doesn't really work for your joke, you can start from scratch :).

## Assignments

## For the one-liners

Write 3 set-ups which create some sort of expectation.

For instance, A potential one is "I'm trying to quit sugar this year." There's the assumption that you're trying to quit for health reasons, or that the sugar you eat is from normal sweet foods like candy. These can potentially be subverted.

### For the hot takes

Play Devil's Advocate to a couple popular opinions now. Write some ideas how you can (comedically) justify your view. 

For instance, I don't think everyone should go to therapy is a potential Devils' Advocate take.
