# Editing

Sometimes comedy feels like waiting for the universe to grant you a joke. You're in a car, your mind is wandering, and boom you have a fully formed joke just bestowed upon you.

You should seize these gifts, of course, but in order to not feel like comedy is just playing some cosmic lottery, you must also learn how to edit jokes that don't work, and punch-up jokes that sort of work. 

In this lesson, we'll talk about editing, fixing, and punching-up jokes. 

## Writing vs Editing

For me, writing new ideas is all about letting my brain run freely. I try to write freely, without filters, in a stream of conscious-like manner. 

In contrast, I would say editing is very systematic, very concrete, and very goal-directed. Having clear goals when sitting down to work on a joke is necessary to have productive results. 

## Have the Joke In Front Of You

You need something in front of you to edit. In order to work on a joke, you need either a written version of it or a taped recording of it in front of you. Read it or listen to it to start.

## You Need Good Sample Sizes

Its hard to know what works or doesn't work if you've never performed a joke, or only performd it once. Running jokes with the same wording multiple times (at different open mics) is necessary to get the statistical power needed to know which parts work, and which parts didn't work. Don't let a weird room make you completely revamp a joke that already might work. 

## Fixing or Punching-up?

There's a big difference between getting something working, and improving something that already works. In the latter, you don't want to mess with the major beats, and instead cut things that take-away from the joke, and add in only that which sharpens in.

In the former, fixing a broken joke sometimes means completely reworking the joke. Here's a couple tips for getting a joke working. 

### Work on broken jokes that you're excited about

In stand-up, usually your first pass at a joke is a pretty good attempt. If a joke completely doesn't work your first few times trying it, it'll likely be a lot of work to get it working. This doesn't mean don't work on jokes that don't work the first time, I'm just saying only work on it if you really like the idea or truly believe that it is promising. 

### Do they know what you're talking about?

Most of the times when a joke completely fails, it is not because they've all simultaneously deemed it unfunny. More often than not, they have no idea what you're talking about.

Start with if it is clear what you're getting at. Make sure there's no information you assumed people knew but they actually do not. Running ideas in conversation with friends/comics is a good way to get at this question of if you're just incomprehensible.

### Think about set-up and punchline

Revisit Week 2 ideas, and identify set-up and punchlines. Are these clearly separated? Is the punchline at the end? Is everything in the set-up necessary for the punchline to work? 
### Go big

Okay, once you've gone through the basics of seeing if there isn't anything structurally unsound about the jokes, maybe you just need to make the punchline funnier.

One great way is adding hyperbole. After the initial joke about not seeing Ben And Jerry's in the daylight, watch how Maddie grossly exaggerates just to capture the simple idea of liking Ben And Jerry's.

## Fixing

Lets start with "broken" jokes, jokes you've written that don't work, and how to "fix" these jokes. 

### Do They Understand What You're Talking About

Sometimes they have no idea what you're tlaing about. Truly.
