# Editing

Sometimes comedy feels like waiting for the universe to grant you a joke. You're in a car, your mind is wandering, and boom you have a fully formed joke just bestowed upon you.

You should seize these gifts, of course, but in order to not feel like comedy is just playing some cosmic lottery, you must also learn how to edit jokes that don't work, and punch-up jokes that sort of work. 

In this lesson, we'll talk about editing, fixing, and punching-up jokes. 

## Writing vs Editing

For me, writing new ideas is all about letting my brain run freely. I try to write freely, without filters, in a stream of conscious-like manner. 

In contrast, I would say editing is very systematic, very concrete, and very goal-directed. Having clear goals when sitting down to work on a joke is necessary to have productive results. 

## Have the Joke In Front Of You

You need something in front of you to edit. In order to work on a joke, you need either a written version of it or a taped recording of it in front of you. Read it or listen to it to start.

## You Need Good Sample Sizes

Its hard to know what works or doesn't work if you've never performed a joke, or only performd it once. Running jokes with the same wording multiple times (at different open mics) is necessary to get the statistical power needed to know which parts work, and which parts didn't work. Don't let a weird room make you completely revamp a joke that already might work. 

## Fixing or Punching-up?

There's a big difference between getting something working, and improving something that already works. In the latter, you don't want to mess with the major beats, and instead cut things that take-away from the joke, and add in only that which sharpens in.

In the former, fixing a broken joke sometimes means completely reworking the joke. Here's a couple tips for getting a joke working. 

### Work on broken jokes that you're excited about

In stand-up, usually your first pass at a joke is a pretty good attempt. If a joke completely doesn't work your first few times trying it, it'll likely be a lot of work to get it working. This doesn't mean don't work on jokes that don't work the first time, I'm just saying only work on it if you really like the idea or truly believe that it is promising. 

### Do they know what you're talking about?

Most of the times when a joke completely fails, it is not because they've all simultaneously deemed it unfunny. More often than not, they have no idea what you're talking about.

Start with if it is clear what you're getting at. Make sure there's no information you assumed people knew but they actually do not. Running ideas in conversation with friends/comics is a good way to get at this question of if you're just incomprehensible.

### Think about set-up and punchline

Revisit Week 2 ideas, and identify set-up and punchlines. Are these clearly separated? Is the punchline at the end? Is everything in the set-up necessary for the punchline to work? 

## Improving jokes

If people understand the joke and you have a few punchlines, but the reception is still lukewarm, what do you do now? Here's some ideas on how to make tsomething funnier.

### Go bigger

Add hyperbole. Try going bigger, more fantastical, more rowdy, more dirty, more of whatever is the funny part of your joke. See how Maddie Wiener escalates how much she likes Ben Jerry by going big and dirty.

### Go smaller

Understatement can work in the same way as exaggeration. Sheng Wang frequently employs this by having a rapidly escalating set-up and then having a deadpan punchline where he responds in a relaxed, understated way. Note the decompression from the set-up ("they smash your balls multiple times") to the punchline ("I probably don't got it").

### Flip the punchline and set-up

It suprises me how often a joke can still make sense when you flip the punchline and the set-up. See this Ian Edwards joke, where the punchline reveals he never watched the Michael Jackson documentary. Here, this joke could have very easily been written such that in the set-up he references he never seen the Michael Jackson documentary, and thats why he can enjoy his music. Instead, he formats it cleverly about how big of a piece of shit you'd have to be to watch the documentary and enjoy MJs music, before revealing he never watched the documentary.
