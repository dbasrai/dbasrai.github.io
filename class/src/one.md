# Premises

When sitting down to write a joke for the first time, a lot of new comics rack their brains to try and think of something funny. Which is logical. But its hard to generate something funny out of thin air, and I think can lead to converge on topics that are "intrinsically" funny like sex and bodily excretions. 

Instead, I'd suggest focusing on finding a premise first, and then writing around that. A premise is the broad term for an idea or angle driving a joke. For a more specific definition which will have exceptions, I'd say a premise is an interesting opinion that needs to be justified or explained. Importantly, premises do not necessarily have to be funny... just interesting. The funny part comes after. Lets ground in some examples. 

## Obervations

In observational comedy, the premise is generally an observation of something commonplace that you think is odd, or weird, or some other emotion.

In this great Laura Peek joke, the premise is that it is odd that woman's bathrooms say no "foreign" objects. That is the main idea behind the joke, and the funny comes from various examples. Again, the observation of the word "foreign" isn't funny in itself, but it is interesting and can be explained. 

In some cases, the premise is pretty inseparable from the joke itself. In this Louis Katz bit, the premise that NYE has the worst parts of all the other holidays is pretty much a step away from the joke... but note that it still needs to be explained through example. If your premise is JUST the joke, you rarely have somewhere to go.

A pure observational joke like these can be difficult. There's a lot of people trying to be funny on the internet, and with how easy it is to post a joke on twitter or a front-facing reel on Instagram, most of the mid-to-low hanging fruit have been plucked. When trying to come up with observations, sometimes looking at things that have changed in the last decade, without necessarily being "news-cycle topical", is more ripe for an original idea.

## Takes

Other types of jokes with readily apparent premises are "takes," or just strong, sometimes controversial opinions that need to be justified. Again, the takes themselves do not have to be funny. In this joke by Gastor Almonte, his overaching premise that oatmeal is bad isn't necessary funny... its in his reasoning where the humor comes.

Another good example is Maddie Wiener explaining why plus-sized models aren't relatable to regular plus-sized people.

Again, the joke is largely driven by an interesting idea/take, that perhaps in itself isn't "funny." 

## Personal

I am largely using the word "interesting" to describe premises that can be mined for jokes, but its not easy to have a good intuition for what is interesting. One clue that a premise is interesting is that it is based on a personal situation, but can be made into a more general statement.

In this Mekki Leeper, he starts off with the highly specific story that his GF left him for a basketball player. But I think he is effective at generalizing it to the general odd feeling of your GF leaving you for someone "better".

## Practical Suggestions for Generating Premises

Here are some general tips of generating good premises. 

### Find Something Surprising About Yourself

Find a fact that people would find surprising about you. Justify why it is surprising, or shouldn't be surprising.

### Be the Devil's Advocate

Find a controversial opinion, but justify it.

### Find what irritates

Find something you find irritating that others might not. Justify it.
