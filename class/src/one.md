# Be Yourself Up There

Great sets radiate the comedian's personality and ideas. The best punchlines hit not only because they're well-crafted, but because they simultaneously perfectly capture a comedian's unique sense of humor and worldview. With just a few concise lines, the audience suddenly sees the world from the eyes of whoever is on stage... and this is what makes jokes hit hardest. 

The next 7 lessons give guidelines and exercises to learn technical writing and sharp performance. Unforunately, these skills can sometimes pull the comedian away from talking about something they actually care about and find funny. Sometimes technique obfuscates who the comedian really is as a person, which renders the stand-up meaningless, or worse, unfunny. 

Everything about stand-up has to bleed you. The more "you" that permeates every idea, word, pause... the harder the jokes will hit. 

Throughout the course, I'd return to this question: "am I being myself up there?"

## Write what you care about

Making something funny is hard, but I'd advise against choosing topics or ideas SIMPLY because they seem easier to make funny.

Write about things what you care about (and remember, those things can be dumb and silly). Some comics will have a joke fall flat and remark that it was only for a few people in the room. While I'd say in most cases that joke was for no one in the room and was bad, you should think about what jokes what be just "for you?" What topics would you be so excited if a comic was talking about... that's the joke you should write.

See Gary Gulman for a whole set clearly springing from some minutiae about abbreviations that caught his eye.

When a comic is talking about something they care about, it is almost a lens into who they are. You probably never really know somebody until they are talking about something they're excited about.  

## What irritates?

Does it feel hard to even come up with what you care about? Then write about what irritates you. Stand-up is a lot of the time just sophisticated complaining. And if something bothers you, it probably bothers a lot of people, so people will almost always be on board.

Check this Pat Burtscher set, it drips with hilarious negativity.

Here, Pat is complaining about deep societal rot, but you don't have to be as grand in scope. Find mundanity that bothers you, especially something that other people seem to not even notice. That reveals something about you. 

## Show, Not Tell

Over the set, the comedian must explain who they are. My favorite sets are the ones who do so in the comedy equivalent of "showing, not telling." They don't start with a barrage of facts about where they grew up, what their parents were like, what their current job is... instead their subject matter, their logic, their dress, their cadence make it clear. 

Dusty Slay, a comic largely unknown when they debuted on the Tonight Show, nails this.

Sharp, concise sets take advantage of the fact that audiences have assumptions based on their first impression of a comedian. If certain assumptions are correct, you can leave them unsaid and get to the point. If the assumptions are incorrect, you can then subvert these for a joke. But try and learn what the audience is assuming about you, it might not always perfectly line up with what you're trying to project.  

## Conversational

Great sets feel like conversations. The nice part is everyone has their own way of being conversational. Find how you like to have conversations with your friends... do you ramble through a story, do you mostly remain silent but hop in with witty lines, do you hold court explaining an idea? 

Do that on stage.

Jo Firestone has a style that reminds me of a friend who instantly becomes self-conscious that they're leading the conversation, and is dying for someone else to hop in. Somehow, you can make that work in stand-up.

## In-class Exercises

1) Write 3 facts about yourself. Make 1 of them you think something the audience ASSUMES about you from seeing you, and make of them something the audience would be SURPRISED to learn from you. Discuss if these assumptions are true.

2) Write down 2 things that irritate you. Make 1 of them something you think is universally disliked. Make the 2nd something you think you particularly hate, but others feel neutral about. Discuss if these assumptions are true
