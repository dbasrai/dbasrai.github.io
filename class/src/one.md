# Premises

A premise is the idea behind a joke. Good premises are generally ideas that are original and interesting, but not necessarily funny. A good premise should give you something to talk about, where you can then be funny.

## Observations

The most straightforward premise is an observation. Observational comedy is noticing parts of everyday life that the audience can relate to.

In this case, the premise is the observation itself. There's many examples, here's a modern example I like.

A pure observational joke like this can be difficult. There's a lot of people trying to be funny on the internet, and with how easy it is to post a joke on twitter or a front-facing reel on Instagram, most of the mid-to-low hanging fruit have been plucked.

## Takes

A good premise doesn't have to be funny in itself. In fact, for the most part, I think it is a common mistake to try and come up with a funny premise. 

An example of a premise is a "take," that is, a viewpoint. If a hot take is funny intrinsically, it tends to feel sardonic. A great take usually is a surpising, interesting idea, that is made funny through its justification. 

Here's an example of a simple take... that oatmeal is bad. I'd say it
