## Lesson Overview

Each lesson, we'll start by having some people pitch some jokes they wrote over the past week.

Then, I'll go over the material of the week, albeit in a more discussion-based manner.

Peppered in throughout, we'll break into small groups and do some of the listed group exercises.

*It is highly encouraged to read through the weeks write-up here prior to coming to class, and watch the embedded clips.*
