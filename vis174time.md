# Time

In this week's sketch I again wanted to do something comedic, and the promopt of time immediately gave me a lot to think about. I settled on doing something with flashbacks, and after debating a couple ideas, I centered on the central punchline of a guy going to his therapist for a condition where he gets incessant flashbacks, and his therapist immediately asks him to tell him about his child, prompting a flashback. Finally, the end reveals that the entire film was just a flashback when a new therapist asks him about his old therapist. I think the premise had a litte bit of inspiration in the Futurama episode 'Anthology of Interest Pt 1,' mostly in terms of the way a device causes a flashback that envelops the whole screen, as well as the end revealing the rest of the episode to be a flashback. 

overall, the execution wasn't very good. I think having spent time in pre-production for this film would have helped --- having scouted out a proper office set, proper therapist attire, and a proper door would have elevated the sketch a lot. Also sound was again really bad --- in the future I will make sure to get a tascam or something similar. 

The constraints of having to film in my house again really put hurt the camerawork; my house is evenly lit and there is random, immovable stuff everywhere so I couldn't place the camera in ideal spots. Also just the weird maze like layout of my own place, I can't get quite a nice establishing shot, so we are thrust straight into this closeup of my face which makes the whole thing fel weird and un-contextualized. 

In terms of the writing, the joke just comes way too fast. I think I have to someone lean into the condition, explaining it, and then somehow then get into the therapist line of "so tell me about your childhood." I'm not exactly positive how to accomplish this.

Finally, the ending punch didnt quite pan out as intended; the timing was slightly off so it doesnt quite work that well. Also since I had to sometimes shoot some scenes I was in, the focus was very slightly off, which was uncomfortable. 

I think again the idea had potential, it just needed to be elevated by various pre-production elements and more interesting camerawork. I think I was limited significantly by the number of hands I had; I had only me and 1 actor, and the actor had never used a camera before, so I had to set up many shots of me by myself and then essentially run into the shot, which made a very simple shot be both constrained and uninteresting while requiring a lot of effort from me.
