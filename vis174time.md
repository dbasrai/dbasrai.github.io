# Time

In this week's sketch I again wanted to do something comedic, and the promopt of time immediately gave me a lot to think about. I settled on doing something with flashbacks, and after debating a couple ideas, I centered on the central punchline of a guy going to his therapist for a condition where he gets incessant flashbacks, and his therapist immediately asks him to tell him about his child, perompting a flashback. 

however, despite the relatively simple plot, the execution wasn't very good. I think having spent time in pre-production for this film would have helped --- having scouted out a proper office set, proper therapist attire, and a proper door would have elevated teh sketch a lot. Also sound was again really bad --- in the future I will make sure to get a tascam or something similar. Finally, the ending punch didnt quite pan out as intended; the timing was slightly off so it doesnt quite work that well. Also since I had to sometimes shoot some scenes I was in, the focus was very slightly off, which was uncomfortable.
