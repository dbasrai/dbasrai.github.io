# Pre Production

[video](https://youtu.be/US-70SOcKEY)

Throughout the class, I wanted to make a video set to audio of my standup, but always felt like getting footage that was technically good enough (in regard to location, lighting, props, acting, etc.), it always felt overwhelming. However, this prompt I think gave me a very ideal workspace to come up with some idea of how it would look. Already having audio also gave this project a very clear direction and allowed me to focus on just visualizing how it was gonna be. 

Personally, I feel like my favorite part of filmmaking is the screenwriting aspect, and although this was pre-production I realized I had to do something more visually aligned, and thus decided with a pseudo-mix between a storyboard and a shotlist, where I wasn't quite drawing exactly what was hapening on screen but instead just gave a somewhat vague image of what I wanted to get across. 

I wish I had slightly better art skills, but I think the project ended up being a fair representation of what I wanted to do. Making it actually got me a little bit excited and expired to actually follow through and do the project, and going through the process of actually storyboarding it made me realize it was perhaps more doable and less technical than I expected.
