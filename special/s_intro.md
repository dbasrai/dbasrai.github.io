before I start, I do want to be briefly herafelt. and I can't have this on camera because it'll ruin my hard man image. if we want this on netflix, it has to be irreverent and boundaryless, can't be thanking people like a pussy. 

but i started standup here in san diego 7ish years ago, and i would go see a lot of shows here at whistle stop bar. it was always this artistic hub in san degio, there was storytelling shows here, there wwas live music, there was standup, and I always had this dream of filming a special here at whistlestop, so first of all thank you so so much for coming out and selling out both shows. especially thanks for coming out on a wednesday. I'll be honest, that part wasn't necessarily part of the dream. I didn't have a fridge magnet with the word 'wednesday' on the vision board. 

what happened was that i reached out to whistle stop and gave a similar schpeal about it being the artistic hub of san diego and i would love to do something if there's a saturday in juyl open. and whistle stop was like, we're into this idea, but on saturdays we do booty basement. and we cant reschedule booty basement. 

if you don't know what booty basmenet is, its uh... not the storytelling show. 

theres usually stories told about booty basement, but not the story telling shopw. 

but here's the thing, they're right. and this is will be worse than booty basement. no matter how well it goes. like if my set goes perfect, you guys will have a worse time than the people at booty basement.

great stand-up is about equal in happiness to like a mediocre booty basement. 

becuse today im filming my special, but at booty asement its everyone's specail.
