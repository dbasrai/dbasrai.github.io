# chuck e cheese

my parents are immigrants. but i was born here ______

my parents were refugees, and they came to this country with nothing, but I didn't grow up poor --- my parents found decent jobs, but they were deeply frugal about everything

like,I remember when they would take me to chuck-e-cheese, they would always get the cheapest token package, which was 12 tokens, and then split it among me and my two siblings. So I would start at chuck-e-cheese with 4 tokens. And that's not enough tokens where a kid can be a kid. 4 tokens? that's where a kid can feel real poor... and again it was confusing because my parents had decent jobs, so the only time i felt like a broke children of refugees was at chuck-e-cheese. 

like at home i never heard my parents worrying about money, but at chuck-e-cheese I had to play a lot of dry air hockey

my white friends moms would look so concerned at me on all fours picking up loose tickets off the floor, pushing the orange refund button just hopping something would come out.. 

when you don't have many tokens at chuck-e-cheese, you spend a lot of time playing in the tubes. 

do you guys remember the chuck-e-cheese tubes?

but more importantly, do you guys remember the kind of kids... IN the chuck-e-cheese tubes?

every kid in the tubes was weird as shit. 

because on the ground the kids are like I've crunched the numbers, and this is the game that will maximize the tickets per unit token.

in the tubes the kids are like y'all wanna pretend to be rats?

i grew up during no child left behind, and let me tell you, if you've ever been in the tubes there's been kids left behind.

In the tubes in my chuck-e-cheese there was always just one kid just potsed up, blocking the tubes. Did y'all have one of these bridge trolls in your local tubes? you're like trying to get around him, and he's like first.... you must answer these three riddles.

I know some of you are thinking --- I don't remember the tubes being that bad, they were fun. But what you're missing is that it matters when you enter the chuck-e-cheese tubees.

because late in the afternoon, thats when the well-off kids start head up to the tubes, around 3-4pm the kids whose parents own a pool, the kids whose parents got the deluxe birthday party package, they're up there gentrifying the tubes.

but the true tubekids, we're the ones who've had to enter the tubes... early in the day. 

like have you ever had to enter the tubes... before pizza... that's when the most fucked up kids imaginable are in there.

it was dangeorus in there.

i once got mugged in the tubes. I turned a corner, and a kid pulled out one of those time crisis arcade guns. he's like I'm getting back down to the ground with my friends, so we can do this the easy way or the hard way

at least at the front of the tubes, the kids still want to make it back down to the games. but if you ever start crawling and journeying deep, you start meeting hte kids who've embraced the tubes. 

like when you start going deep in the tubes, you start meeting these pan labyrinth kids who've adapted to the darkness. you can't even see them at first, you can only make them out by their purple glow-in-the-dark chuck-e-cheese handstamps. 

i've gone even deeper in the tubes. you can keep crawling, the tubes start narrowing, you start seeing tallymarks on the wall.

if you go deep enough you eventually start encountering former members of the chuck-e-cheese band? you pass a animantronic racooon, holding a tambourine, and he's just  muttering about revenge against the rat who took his place..

you keep crawling, you pass three dead kids, at this point you're not even in the chuck-e-cheese anymore, you're in the liquor store across the street.

and then you see a light. and at the end of the tubes, there's a ballpit. and in that ballpit sits a kid... meditating. and as you approach, he opens his eyes and goes 'i've been waiting a long time for you, Diya.' And you get closer, you see an adams apple and defined cheekbones, you realize this isn't a child in here, this is a fucking 14 year old. And this teenager wisely strokes the peach fuzz and goes 'I first entered the tubes 7 years ago... and now you take my place.'

i think about chuck-e-cheese a lot, because I think a chuck-e-cheese is really your first encounter with capitalistsociety. like you work hard, and if you're good, you get rewarded at the end with prizes? and I feel like what games you're drawn to as a kid is indicative of what job you end up in as an adult. 

like I'm a very mellow, consistent person, and as a kid I would always play skeeball. Just consistent, throw it up the middle, and I would do fine, I would make 4-5 tickets a game, an honest middle class living at chuck e cheese. (clock in clock out pay my dues)

but my best friend as a kid was this white kid named Jordan. and Jordan would exclusively play that game you shoot a coin into that coin bulldozer game? everyone who played that coin bulldozer game is really into cryptocurrency now. 

and the same thing Jordan said last week when he lost $5000 on ethereum he first said 18 years ago at chuck-e-cheese. I was watching him play that coin bulldozer game and I was like hey buddy, you are making 0 tickets, i think you're wasting your tokens. And he's just like oh it'll fall for me one day. and let me tell you, it has never fallen for him.  

at chuck-e-cheese i was like i'll help you, I grabbed the game and started shaking it, he was like stop it that's market manipulation.

for most kids, chuck-e-cheese is really the first time you buy things with currency that you yourself has earned. and something really changes in your brain that first time you exchange tickets for a prize. like you walk in to chuck-e-cheese as this innocent 8 year old saying things like 'sharing is caring,' and you leave talking about 'private property' and 'the free market'

I remember that first time i paid for a prize, it was like something shifted in my brain. I paid 200 tickets for the woopie cushion, which by the way, still gave me the biggest laugh I ever got. no matter how well this goes today, its all chasing the high i got when i put the whoopie cushion under my moms seat. 

but I got this woopie cushion, and Jordan comes over and is like hell yeah, can I see it. And up to this point me and Jordan were inseparable, we would share lunches, we would borrow each others video games. but the minute I got a woopie cushion from hard days work skeeballing, and Jordan was like can I see it... I was like... what do you want to see it for? Hey don't just grab... you've never worked a god damn day in your life Jordan, and here you are trying to leech off my private property. 

I really think the purpose of chuck-e-cheese is too indoctrinate kids into capitalism, its like tucker carlsen for kids. like if you stand next to the animatronic chuck-e-cheese , he utters little catchphrases. and the first few things he says are pretty normal, he goes anybody can be a winner, or save up your tickets to win an even bigger prize. but have you ever, kept listening to chuck-e-cheese? after 5 minutes or so, he starts talking about how wealth from the rich will trickle down to the poor. you keep listening, he goes on about how healthcare is a privilege not a right. after 10 minutes or so he just starts changing Trump 2024. But then he clarifies just for his fiscal policies, not his social ones.

chuck-e-cheese also captures how brutal capitalism can really be. One time at Chuck-e-chesee, Jordan hacked one of the games, and he somehow popped it open, and was pulling out a string of tickets. and i'm behind him just cheering. but then I look over and one of the chuck-e-cheese managers sees him. and then he puts a phone up to his ear.

And then I whisper, Hey Jordan, chuck-e-cheese walked over. And he's not paying attention, he's like what. And I'm Jordan, the chuck. e cheese is over here. And Jordan is still just pulling out free tickets. And finally I go. Jordan. Charles Entertainment Cheese is right here. And then Jordan looks up at him towering right over him. And then chuck-e-cheese beats the shit out of Jordan. The whole band comes over and kicks his ass.

I really think Chuck-e-cheese is important for kids. I really think it teaches the realities of a capitalist society. It taught me that there were things I can never afford. Like do you remember how much the prizes in the back costed? The Remote-control helicopter was 300,000 tickets. 

You can't afford that with a skeeballers salary. I can skeeball 40 hours per week and I'll never get close. 

And I'm just telling the guy like, that's impossible to ever get the remote control helicopter. But then suddenly Jordan walks over, with a bundle of tickets, and gets the helicopter. And the chuck-e-cheese guy is just like, see what happens when you stop wasting your tickets on whoopie cushions and rubber sticky hands and actually save up? But you have a poverty mentality. 

And I'm loking at Jordans huge stack of tickets. And at first I was like he probably won the coin bulldozer jackpot. He persevered, never gave up, pulled himself up by his velco straps and was rewarded. The American dream is dream the system wroks.

And then I was like that's so many god damn tickets. So I asked him. I was like hey Jordan, how'd you get this many tickets..

And he's like oh I won some of these today, but my brother, he got too old for chuck-e-cheese and gave me the rest of his, and actually most of these are from my dad when he was a kdi at chuck e cheese.

And that's when I learned that if you're white. Chuck-e-cheese tickets just run in your family. White people have chuck-e-cheese genrational wealth. 

My parents are refugees, I came to this chuck-e-cheese with nothing just the clothes on my back. Jordan apparently started off with a chuck-e-trust fund.

And Jordan was old money, he pulled out a ticket, it was from 1835. he was like this is a ticket from my great grandfather. it had a confederate flag on the bakc. it didn't even have chuckecheese on it, it had a racoon holding a tambourine. 


the other day I was at dave and busters........... love
