# chuck e cheese

my parents are immigrants. but i was born here ______

growing up my parents really cared about giving me american experiences, but they never quite got it right 
 
like as a kid, my parents would take me to chuck-e-cheese all the time, because that was a very american thing to do.

but they'd never acutally get me tokens. 

have you ever been to an arcade without tokens? my entire childhoold, I've had to play a lot of  dry air hockey...

i think about chuck-e-cheese a lot, because I think a chuck-e-cheese is a microcosm of american society. like you work hard, and if you're good, you get rewarded at the end with prizes? and I realize now that how you act as a kid at chuck-e-cheese is very indicative of the rest of your life. in fact, every person i meet, i know as kids what their favorite chuck-e-cheese games were 

like the crypto dudes you meet nowadays? as kids, they were always the ones throwing tokens into that coin bulldozer game? just like this is how i make my fortune, keep putting coins in, you've gotta hold. some kids like shaking it, and its like hey man thats market manipulation. stop it. 

and all the people with non-traditional lifestyles? people living in vans, people living off-grid, the homeless. those are the kids who were like fuck the system, lets just play in the chuck-e-cheese tubes

the kids in the tubes were always weird as hell. you'd walk into chuck-e-cheese, they'd be staring at you through the clear plastic end, and you'd be like don't make eye contact, I'm never going to end up in there.

chuck-e-cheese tubes were sketchy dude, the tubes were the hood of chuck-e-cheese.

I once got mugged in the chuck-e-cheese tubes. 

like i was crawling around in the tubes, and i hear a noise behind me, and I can't get a good look but i was like is this kid following me? it is a one-way tube so its hard to tell. and then suddenly I hit a dead end, and i finally turn around to look, and i realize there's a god damn 14 year old behind me. he's like i've been living here for the last seven years. he was terrifying, he had temporary tattoos on his face, and then suddenly he pulls out one of those Time Crisis plastic arcade  guns 

He's like we can do this the easy way or the hard way.

i think chuck-e-cheese really does reflect growing up in an american capitalist society. like the other day, i went on zillow and that feeling in my stomach when i saw how much a house costed was the same feeling i first had when i was 7 in chuck-e-cheese when I realized I was never going to afford a prize from the back. 1 million dollars, 50,000 tickets, they're the same imaginary amount of  money. 

I remember so clearly, I was at chuck-e-cheese, getting like 4-5 tickets a arcade game, you know, a healthy middle-class living. and then i go up to the counter with 200 tickets. and the guy is liek with that amount you can poke around in the back.

chuck-e-cheese where kids can be kids? it should be where kids find out whatpoverty is. chuck-e-cheese is the first time i couldn't afford something, and that feeling sticks with you for life. 

from the moment i walkted into chuck-e-cheese, all I wanted was this remote-controlled helicopter. i'm sure the same emotions of optimism and hope for a better life that my parents felt when flying into new york and seeing all the skyscrapers, that was what i felt when i first walked into chuck-e-cheese, and i saw a remote-controlled helicopter sitting in the back. 

chuck-e-cheese, even though its for kids, its just as indifferent and uncaring as society. yall ever fuck up a chuck-e-cheese game so bad that it only spits one ticket out? it doesn't even come out all the way. they make you get down on your knees to reach in and pull it out. its like chuck-e-cheese is going beg for the scrap you peasent. you  deserved half a ticket for that one. 





continue? I've never been able to continue ein my life.
