# chuck e cheese

my parents are immigrants. but i was born here ______

my parents were refugees, and they came to this country with nothing, but they did both find decent jobs, the things is that they were just constantly aware that at any point they might lose it all, like in their home county, and were deeply frugal.  

like,I remember when they would take me to chuck-e-cheese, they would always get the cheapest token package, which was 12 tokens, and then split it among me and my two siblings. So I would start at chuck-e-cheese with 4 tokens. And that's not enough tokens where a kid can be a kid. 4 tokens? that's where a kid can feel real poor... and again it was confusing because my parents had decent jobs, so the only time i felt like a broke children of refugees was at chuck-e-cheese. 

like at home i never heard my parents worrying about money, but at chuck-e-cheese I had to play a lot of dry air hockey

like i never had to collect and separate cans as a kid but at chuck-e-cheese i was picking up loose tickets off the floor, pressing every single orange refund button just hoping something would come out. I would dumpster-dive as an 8 year old, but only in chuck-e-cheese trashcans. Just pilfering for acccidentally discarded tickets. 

when you don't have many tokens at chuck-e-cheese, you spend a lot of time playing in the tubes. 

do you guys remember the chuck-e-cheese tubes?

but more importantly, do you guys remember the kind of kids... IN the chuck-e-cheese tubes?

every kid in the tubes was weird as shit. 

because on the ground the kids are like I've crunched the numbers, and this is the game that will maximize the tickets per unit token.

in the tubes the kids are like y'all wanna pretend to be rats?

tubes are narnia for kids who like to scamper. 

every kid in the tubes was weird as shit. I atually think the tubes are where weird kids are made. 

like the roller backpack kid or the kid who wheres a suit to class... he isn't born... one day he just emerges from the tubes. 

right nown there's like 8 kids who will naruto run just gestating in the tubes right now. one day they'll hatch and be unleashed on us all.

the tubes are a perilous place. I've made it to the end of the tubes. It's not easy. Because have any of you ever gone deep in the tubes? That's when you start encountering the kids who've spent too long in the dark.

that's when you start meeting these pans labyrnth kids. they've lost the use of their eyes, they have a little lightpole sticking out. 

if you make it past these kids and continue venturing down the tubes, they start narrowing, you start seeing tally-marks on the walls. 

Eventually you start encountering former members of the chuck-e-cheese band. You see a animnotric racoon holding a tambourine, he's asking if you have any cigarettes

You keep venturing down. the tubes stop being multi-colored plastic, its just white PVC pipe at some point. You pass 3 dead kids. At this point you're not even in the chuckpe-cheese anymore, you're in the liquor store across the street.

and at the end of the tubes, there's a ballpit. and in that ballpit sits a kid... meditating. and as you approach, he opens his eyes and goes 'i've been waiting a long time for you, Diya.' And you get closer, you see an adams apple and defined cheekbones, you realize this isn't a child in here, this is a fucking 14 year old. And this teenager wisely strokes the peach fuzz and goes 'I first entered the tubes 7 years ago... and now you take my place.'


i think about chuck-e-cheese a lot, because I think a chuck-e-cheese is really your first encounter with capitalistsociety. like you work hard, and if you're good, you get rewarded at the end with prizes? and I feel like what games you're drawn to as a kid is indicative of what your job you end up in as an adult. 

like I'm a very mellow, consistent person, and as a kid I would always play skeeball. Just consistent, throw it up the middle, and I would do fine, I would make 4-5 tickets a game, an honest middle class living at chuck e cheese. (clock in clock out pay my dues)

but I would also have these buddies who would play those all-or-nothing type of game. like I would have this buddy who would only play the game where you shoot a coin into that coin bulldozer game? everyone who played that coin bulldozer game is really into cryptocurrency now. 

Because even back then, I was like hey buddy, you have made 0 tickets, I think you're wasting your tokens. And he's like it'll fall for me one day.
 
i was like i'll help you, I grabbed the game and started shaking it, he was like stop it that's market manipulation.

i really think the purpose behind chuck-e-cheese is to make kids embrace capitalism. they walk into those gold and purple doors being like 'sharing is caring,' and 'if you can bring it for one person, bring it for everyone.' then that first time you exchange tickets you earned for a prize. these 8 year olds walk out flashing their new woopie cushion at homeless people being like 'look if you just worked hard and pulled yourself up by your boostrap.'

every part of chuck-e-cheese... indoctrinate you into capitalsim. there used to be an animatronic chuck-e-cheese you can push to say catchphrases... seventh or 8th presses.

even the prizses. whoopie cushion, rubber sticky hand, and whats that is that a copy of atlas shrugged.

because Chuck-e-cheese was the first time in my life I couldn't afford something. Because I didn't grow up rich, but if I wanted something really bad my parents were like 'its a little expensive, but if you really really want it, we'll trry our best and see what we can do.'

But if you ever go up to the chuck-e-cheese prize counter with not enough tickets? They're not even close to that nice. They're like oh your 7 tickets short, well we don't do handouts here at chuck-e-cheese. This isn't the school fair, we don't do participation prizes here. 

Oh.. the little snowflake is now crying?? Life isn't fair. This is god damn chuck-e-cheese, act like you've been here before. 

chuck-e-cheese really teaches you about the true realities about capitalism. It taught me that there were things I can never afford. Like do you remember how much the prizes in the back costed? The Remote-control helicopter was 300,000 tickets. 

You can't afford that with a skeeballers salary. I can skeeball 40 hours per week and I'll never get close. 

And that was such an important lesson, because the other day I looked up on zillow how much it was cost to buy a house on the west coast. And I was like this is the same as the helicopter. 1.5 million dollars, or 300,000 tickets? Thats the same imaginary amount of money.

And you know when boomers are like, well if you stopped buying avacodo toast and getting coffee, you could buy a house. I don't get mad because it was the same at chuck-e-cheese. Back then they were like, well how about you stop wasting tickets on the whoopie cushion or one of those rubber sticky hands. You'll never save up for the helicopter, and its because you have a poverty mentality. 

I actuaally really believe the point of chuck-e-cheese is to indoctrinate kids with the tenets of capitalism. Do you remember the car where you take pictures with chuck-e-cheese. On there there's this button, where chuck-e-cheese says catchphrases. The first few presses are pretty normal, he goes 'everybody can be a winner,' and 'save up for more and win bigger prizes'

however, by the 6th or 7th press, he starts saying some pretty disturbing things. By press 6 he goes 'the invisible hand guides the free market.' Press 7 he goes 'wealth from the rich will trickle down to the poor.' By the 10th he just goes 'trump 2024'. But then he clarifies that its just for his fiscal policies, not his social policies.

Chuck-e-cheese really is there to indcotrinate kids on all the tenets of capitalism. Like they value property so much there. I remember one of my buddies, he like hacked a game, and was pulling out a string a tickets. And I'm behind him cheering, like this is how we get the helicopter. But then I look over and and one of the chuck-e-cheese mangers sees him. And then he puts a red and blue phone up to his ear. And then at first nothing ahppens. 

And then Chuck-e-cheese walks over. The chuck.. e. cheese. Do you guys not understand, Charles Entertainment Cheese walked over. And then he beat the shit out of my friend. The whole band kicked his ass. He's just like any defense of property is justified.

Chuck-e-cheese even had all the racial inequalities inherent in capitalism. It was all there. 

I remember I was at the munch machine, feeding in my meager amount of tickets. And to my left was this white kid, and he had a long string of tickets just flowing in.

And at first I was like he probably deserved those tickets. He probably worked hard, pulled himself up by his velco straps, the american dream at chuck-e-cheese, the system wroks.

And then I was like that's so many god damn tickets. So I asked him. I was like hey buddy, how'd you get this many tickets.

And he's like oh I won some of these today, but my brother, he got too old for chuck-e-cheese and gave me the rest of his, and actually most of these are from my dad when he was a kdi at chuck e cheese.

And that's when I learned that if you're white. Chuck-e-cheese tickets just run in your family. White people have chuck-e-cheese genrational wealth. And this kid was old money, he pulled out a token, it was from 1835. he was like this is my great grandfathers token. it had a confederate flag on hte back. it didn't even have chuckecheese on it, it had a racoon holding a tambourine. 

the other day I was at dave and busters........... love
