# chuck e cheese

my parents are immigrants. but i was born here ______

my parents were refugees, and I think the first mental image of a refugee is someone who's poor and struggling to get by. But my parents had decent jobs, but they were just constantly aware that at any point they might lose it all, like in their home county, and were deeply frugal. which can be confusing growing up. 

like,I remember when they would take me to chuck-e-cheese, they would always get the minimum token package, which was 12 tokens, and then split it among me and my two siblings. So I would start at chuck-e-cheese with 4 tokens. And that's not enough tokens where a kid can be a kid. 4 tokens? that's where a kid can feel poor... the only time I felt like the children of refugees was at chuck-e-cheese. 

and it was confusing to be broke but only in a chuck-e-cheese. like at home i never heard my parents worrying about money, but at chuck-e-cheese I had to play a lot of dry air hockey

like i never had to collect and separate cans as a kid but at chuck-e-cheese i was picking up loose tickets off the floor, pressing every single orange refund button just hoping something would come out. I would dumpster-dive as an 8 year old, but only in chuck-e-cheese trashcans. Just pilfering for acccidentally discarded tickets. 

when you don't have many tokens at chuck-e-cheese, you spend a lot of time playing in the tubes. 

do you guys remember the chuck-e-cheese tubes?

but more importantly, do you guys remember the kind of kids... IN the chuck-e-cheese tubes?

every kid in the tubes was weird as shit. 

because on the ground the kids are like I've crunched the numbers, and this is the game that will maximize the tickets per unit token.

in the tubes the kids are like y'all wanna pretend to be rats?

thats the worst part of running out of tokens, is having to play with these godless tube kids.

every kid in the tubes was weird as shit. I atually think the tubes are where weird kids are made. 

like the roller backpack kid or the kid who wheres a suit to class... he isn't born... one day he just emerges from the tubes. 

right nown there's like 8 kids who will naruto run just gestating in the tubes right now. one day they'll hatch and be unleashed on us all.

the tubes are a perilous place. I've made it to the end of the tubes. It's not easy. Because have any of you ever gone deep in the tubes? That's when you start encountering the kids who've spent too long in the dark.

that's when you start meeting these pans labyrnth kids. they've lost the use of their eyes, they have a little lightpole sticking out. 

if you make it past these kids and continue venturing down the tubes, they start narrowing, you start seeing tally-marks on the walls. 

Eventually you start encountering former members of the chuck-e-cheese band. You see a animnotric racoon holding a tambourine, he's asking if you have any cigarettes

You keep venturing down. the tubes stop being multi-colored plastic, its just white PVC pipe at some point. You pass 3 dead kids. At this point you're not even in the chuckpe-cheese anymore, you're in the liquor store across the street.

and at the end of the tubes, there's a ballpit. and in that ballpit sits a kid... meditating. and as you approach, he opens his eyes and goes 'i've been waiting a long time for you, Diya.' And you get closer, you see an adams apple and defined cheekbones, you realize this isn't a child in here, this is a fucking 14 year old. And this teenager wisely strokes the peach fuzz and goes 'I first entered the tubes 7 years ago... and now you take my place.'




i think about chuck-e-cheese a lot, because I think a chuck-e-cheese is a microcosm of american society. like you work hard, and if you're good, you get rewarded at the end with prizes? and I realize now that how you act as a kid at chuck-e-cheese is very indicative of the rest of your life. in fact, every person i meet, i know as kids what their favorite chuck-e-cheese games were 

like the crypto dudes you meet nowadays? as kids, they were always the ones throwing tokens into that coin bulldozer game? just like this is how i make my fortune, keep putting coins in, you've gotta hold. some kids like shaking it, and its like hey man thats market manipulation. stop it. 

and all the people with non-traditional lifestyles? people living in vans, people living off-grid, the homeless. those are the kids who were like fuck the system, lets just play in the chuck-e-cheese tubes

the kids in the tubes were always weird as hell. you'd walk into chuck-e-cheese, they'd be staring at you through the clear plastic end, and you'd be like don't make eye contact, I'm never going to end up in there.

chuck-e-cheese tubes were sketchy dude, the tubes were the hood of chuck-e-cheese.

I once got mugged in the chuck-e-cheese tubes. 

like i was crawling around in the tubes, and i hear a noise behind me, and I can't get a good look but i was like is this kid following me? it is a one-way tube so its hard to tell. and then suddenly I hit a dead end, and i finally turn around to look, and i realize there's a god damn 14 year old behind me. he's like i've been living here for the last seven years. he was terrifying, he had temporary tattoos on his face, and then suddenly he pulls out one of those Time Crisis plastic arcade  guns 

He's like we can do this the easy way or the hard way.

i think chuck-e-cheese really does reflect growing up in an american capitalist society. like the other day, i went on zillow and that feeling in my stomach when i saw how much a house costed was the same feeling i first had when i was 7 in chuck-e-cheese when I realized I was never going to afford a prize from the back. 1 million dollars, 50,000 tickets, they're the same imaginary amount of  money. 

I remember so clearly, I was at chuck-e-cheese, getting like 4-5 tickets a arcade game, you know, a healthy middle-class living. and then i go up to the counter with 200 tickets. and the guy is liek with that amount you can poke around in the back.

chuck-e-cheese where kids can be kids? it should be where kids find out whatpoverty is. chuck-e-cheese is the first time i couldn't afford something, and that feeling sticks with you for life. 

from the moment i walkted into chuck-e-cheese, all I wanted was this remote-controlled helicopter. i'm sure the same emotions of optimism and hope for a better life that my parents felt when flying into new york and seeing all the skyscrapers, that was what i felt when i first walked into chuck-e-cheese, and i saw a remote-controlled helicopter sitting in the back. 

chuck-e-cheese, even though its for kids, its just as indifferent and uncaring as society. yall ever fuck up a chuck-e-cheese game so bad that it only spits one ticket out? it doesn't even come out all the way. they make you get down on your knees to reach in and pull it out. its like chuck-e-cheese is going beg for the scrap you peasent. you  deserved half a ticket for that one. 





continue? I've never been able to continue ein my life.
