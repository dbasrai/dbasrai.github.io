# chuck e cheese

my parents are immigrants. but i was born here ______

it was important for my parents to give me american experiences, but they never quite did it right. growign up they would dress me in clothes they thought were american, but weren't really. so that no matter the weather, i could get bullied.

my entire childhood, they never quite did american things right. as a kid, they would always take me to chuck-e-cheese, but they never acutally bought me tokens. 

so i would have to play the off version of arcade games. like skeeball? i would just bring shit from home to throw in the holes.

i'm seorius man, my entire childhood i've been playing air hockey dry... this whole imte. 

there would be so much friction the puck couldn't even make it the entire way across the table. 

i was 13 before I even learned you could turn on an air hockey machine. friends are like how was it growing up with asian parents, im just like there was always a lot of friciton. 

skeeball? i would just bring things from home to throw in the machines. 

teh racing games? remember how before you put tokens in, there would just be this looping video playing of people racing. as a kid i would just put my hands hands on the wheel, and imagine that my parents were white. 

i think about chuck-e-cheese a lot, because I think a chuck-e-cheese is almost like a microcosm of american society, a miniature, more colorful version. how you acted as a kid at chuck-e-cheese is very similar to how you work as an adult. in fact, every person i meet, i can tell whjat their favorite games are at a chuck-e-cheese.

like the crypto dudes you meet nowadays? as kids, they were always the ones throwing tokens into that coin bulldozer game? just like this is how i make my fortune, keep putting coins in, you've gotta hold. some kids like shaking it, and its like hey man thats market manipulation. stop it. 

anyone who has a blue-collar, laborer job nowadays always used to love whack-a-mole a little too much. like why is that 9 year old wearing a construction vest and catcalling girls that are walking by.

oh the kid whos favorite games is hitting things that moive, im sure he'll be a scientist or a doctor when he grows up.

and everyone you meet who is unemployed? those are the kids who ran out of tokens too fast, so now they're living in the chuck-e-cheese tubes, and pushing the refund button on any game they walk past. 

the chuck-e-cheese tubes? that was the hood of chuck-e-cheese.

I got mugged in the chuck-e-cheese tubes once. like i was crawling around in the tubes, im looking behind me and im like is this kid following me? it is a tube so its hard not to. and then suddenly I hit a dead end, and thijs kid suddenly pulls out one of those Time Crisis plastic guns. 

He's like we can do this the easy way or the hard way.

i think chuck-e-cheese really does reflect growing up in an american capitalist society? chuck-e-cheese almost trains you how life in society will be. like the same feeling i had just the other day when i went on zillow and saw much buying the house would cost, that was the same feeling i had when i was 7 and I realized I was never going to afford a prize from the back. 1 million dollars, 50,000 tickets, they're the same imaginary, unattainable money. 

I remember so clearly, I was at chuck-e-cheese, getting like 4-5 tickets a arcade game, you know, a healthy middle-class living. and then i go up to the counter with 200 tickets. and the guy is liek with that amount you can poke around in the back.

chuck-e-cheese where kids can be kids? it should be where kids find out whatpoverty is. that's as more accurate slogan.

chuck-e-cheese, even though its for kids, its just as indifferent and uncaring as society. yall ever fuck up a chuck-e-cheese game so bad that it only spits one ticket out? it doesn't even come out all the way. they make you get down on your knees to reach in and pull it out. its like chuck-e-cheese is going beg for the scrap you peasent. you  deserved half a ticket for that one. 





continue? I've never been able to continue ein my life.
