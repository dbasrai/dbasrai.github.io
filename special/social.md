THESIS: History in America is not structured properly. 

FOREST GUMP...

But I don't think it's my fault that I don't know history. I think the public school failed me a little bit. Esp social studies.

We forrest gump social studies teaching a little bit. 

social studies is pretty much taught from the perspective of forrest gump. 

my teacher didn't get to color photographs

the shittiest founding fathres. 

i think the way history is taught fundamentally is poorly structured. We spend so much time on the revolutionary war and the founding fathers. It'll be February and we're still talking about the boston tea party, and May we're signing yearbooks and having class potlucks by the time we have to talk about the jim crow laws.
