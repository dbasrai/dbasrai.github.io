THESIS: History in America is not structured properly. 

my teacher didn't get to color photographs

the shittiest founding fathres. 

i think the way history is taught fundamentally is poorly structured. We spend so much time on the revolutionary war and the founding fathers. It'll be February and we're still talking about the boston tea party, and May we're signing yearbooks and having class potlucks by the time we have to talk about the jim crow laws.
