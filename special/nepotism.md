but I think chuck-e-cheese shows me what the real advantage of being white in america is this access to generations worht of familial resources and connections. and I really only started to understand this recently.

I'm currently working my first full-time job, but i was unemplyoed for a long time after I graduated college, and it was really hard for me to find this job. I remember I was applying to hundreds of job with so little sucess... I remember once I got rejected from a job 10 minutes after I sent an application in.

Do you know how bad it feels to get rejected from a job for being unqualified, when I'm already lying about my qualifications. like even the version of me with 2 extra gpa points, 3 extra years of industry experience... and is a disabled protected veteran. even that diya was unqualified to become a costo greeter.

so it was really hard for me to find a job... and I really thought I did everything right. I studied hard, went to a decent college, and got a pretty practical degree, and it was still so hard to find a job. 

and als the job i did fine is not a great job. I don't make crazy money. I know that because my friend asked me what my salary was, and I had to go to one of those hourly wage to annual salary converters. And if you're ever on one of the converters, you're not making crazy money. no one's ever had to do their hourly wage times * 40 hours a week * times 52 weeks a year, and had six figures come out the end. in that equation btw, of your hourly wage x 40 x 52, in my case, the 40 and the 52 are doing much of the heavy lifting. my salary is pretty close to 40 times 52. 

and for a long time I never quite understood why it was so hard for me to find a mediocre job, when I had all these friends who get these incredible jobs immediately after graduating.

Like my friend Jordan got a 6-figure software engineering job at Dell, straight out of college. But here's the thing... his full name is Jordan Dell.

And I never quite put the pieces togehter... on how he got that job. 

Same with my other buddy, got a presittigous media job right after graduating... his name is Travis Barstool Sports. (silver platter for this man).

and im sick of it. im tired of some white guy telling me to work hard and trust the process, and it turns out his great grandfather invented shoelaces or sometihg.

and i relly believe this is the quiet part of white privilege. the loud, headline-grabbing part is like a white criminal getting a light sentence, but the quiet part is the nepotism. like a video will go viral of a white guy calling the cops on a black person just wandering around, but i also want there to be a shaky video on twitter of a guy with the word Junior in his name filling out the legacy part of a college application.

and that's why if we want to go after rich people, we should start with the people who didn't even do anything to earn their money they just inherited it. 

like instead of first going after Jeff Bezos, we should start with a man named Preston Bezos. Who at age 19, is attending princeeton student and is the ceo of his own start-up engineering company.


so i found preston's instagram.  and I bully him. Because that's how we make change.

Becaue every day, there are people outside Jeff's factories protesting working conditions. And nothing gets done.

But later that day, I DM preston. And remind him his parents got divorced. And once right after I did it, Jeff decided to raise the minimum wage.

I really think that's how we get to billionaire's. Because if I tweet Elon Musk that he's a greedy twat, he'll never see it. But if I find one of his kid's snapchats and tell they they're a twat, they're going to see it, and then at dinner they're goig to be rude to dad. 

if there's trickle down economics, I think there's also trickle up bullying. 

We need to go after billionaire's  kids. like we should take a page out of the book of all the band guys in every action film. They don't go after the main character, they go after the main character's firnds and family.

like in the taken films? they don't go after taken himself. they go after taken's kids and taken's wife. and we got 3 taken movies after that. 

If we really want to solve wealth inequality, stop voting, we just need to do more ransoms. A ransom is just a grassroots wealth tax. Because if we want to solve it through legislation we have to pass a bill through the house, and the senate, and that will never happen. Or we just send Jeff a letter written from cut outletters of magainze that says "if you ever want to see Preston again, donate 30% of your wealth to your local mutual aid group"

And I'm not necessarily saying we should kidnap preston. Legally, I'm not saying we should kidnap Preston. I'm just saying that if we did, we wouldn't have to be violent. We wouldn't have to tie his hands and legs and throw him in the trunk, all we'd have to do is make him seat in the middleseat in a Honda Civic, and he'll be like this is the worst day of my life.

No need to keep him in a dungeon, just make him sleep on a twin size bed in a studio apartment without AC, and he'll be begging dad to rescue him.

I will say, I don't think if you have rich parents, I don't think that makes you a bad person. Like, I don't think you should be ashamed if you're parents are rich.

i just think you should have to disclose it. like when you walk into rooms and stuff. (likea  sex offender).

Because this is a free show on a Wednesday, but there's people with rich parents here right now. Hanging out with us. joking around with us. Sending us venmo requests n shit.

I'll find you. I'll blade runner this room right now, and point you out. 

I started doing research for this joke, and was just blown away how many sucessful people had a rich parent financing their them.

It's really incredible how many musicians have rich parents. Like if you take the last names of all the CEOs of the fortune 500, and put it on a poster, it looks a lot like the Lollapalooza lineup. Like Mac DeMarco's real last name isn't DeMarco. Let me tell you, it has some roman numerals in it. 

Charles Darwin? Do you think you can just charter a boat to the galepogos island on your own dime? He's like sucessful organisms pass down favoriable traits to their offspring. oh, I wonder what inspired that?

I really want to bring to light how intrinsic nepotism is in america. I want to be the martin luther king jr of nepotism

by the way martin luther king... jr? ever wonder how he became the face of the civil rights movement.

I looked it up, but MLK sr was already the head of the NAACP. And I don't know if this is what actaully happened, but I'm just imaging 9-year old martin luther king Jr pushing aside w.e.b dubois and john lewis to get to the front of the boycott.

It relaly is all nepotism. Like do you think its a coincidience that the messiah is also the son of ogod?

do you think he earned that position based on pure righteouess and faith?

Who would get messiah, Simon, Peter, or the guy who's last name is KingoftheJews.

Jesus was not qualified to be messiah. He was bad at it. Do you know how I know that? Because he got crucified at the end.

That's a great sign you're not that good at your job. If you're doing it, and at the end of the workday you get cruciified.

And Jesus's dad bailed him out of death. That's connections. 

And remember, he wasn't the only ones getting crucified. Next to him were these two poor fellas being crucified next to him, whose dads weren't shit. Jesus stepped over their bodies as he left the tomb, just going like 'Trust the process guys.'

By the way, Mac DeMarco's real last name. Mac KingoftheJews.
