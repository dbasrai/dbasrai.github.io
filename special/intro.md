Thanks so much for coming out everyone. I'm really touched that you all spent $15 to come see me. That's a lot of money... that's a lot to ask your friends to spend on you. I can't do a GoFundMe after this. I've cashed out all my GoFundMe favors tonight. If on the way home from the show I get intno a car accident, my GoFundMe will raise $9. I've asked so many people to share the poster for this show, no one will share my GoFundMe. Y'all will instagram story like it at best.

I posted on social media that 'it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came'. I don't have good health insurance. I can't be throwing 'it would really mean a lot to me.' If you don't have an emergency fund, your emergency fund is 'it will realy mean a lot to me' You keep that in your back pocket. facebook is exclusivlely 'it would really mean a lot to me.' thats every post. you ever go to someones wall now? its just birthday and begging. 

the only thing I'm saving is this line. the only thing I haven't burned is 'I never thought I'd ever have to do this, but..." that's the opening line of gofundme. I'll be honest. I've been thinking about doing this. I think about it everyday.
