i just turned 24, and I'm single, and I feel the clock ticking a little bit. I think I'm starting to run out of time. Before I refuse to be over 30 and single. and I have a good reason. the reason is if you're in your 30s and single, you're a little embarrassing to be around.

my advice is this, if you're over 30 and single, you should date someone, because you're making everyone around you feel a little weird. 

and i think if you're over 30 and single, that means something about you. that reflects on you in some way. I've met people in their 20s who are single, and its like you're great, it just might take some time for you to find the right person. everytime i've met someone in their 30s and single, its like oh I can see why no one loves you right now. 

and its your personality. its the inside that counts, and if you're over 30 and single, its th einside that's been rejected. you know all those things that make you you? that's what we hate. 

we should discriminate against people. like be mean to them on an individual leve, but i think it should be done systemically as well..

im single right now. i think im bad at dating. ----

i think its because i didn't date in high school. ---- 

everytime I've dated somebody, I've learned so much. I think you should date in high school. In fact, dating in high school should be mandatory. Like it should be a graduation requirement. 

I think we would all be so much emotionally healthier as a society. We don't need PE. No one's ever lost a bunch of weight, and people are like what did you do, and its like United States Mandated Physical Education.

Instead of an hour of PE, we should just have an hour of going on dates with other students. Instead of running of mile, it should be can you keep a conversation going for the entire class period. Instead of pacers, its can you get to know somebody.

i think you miss out on crucial experiences if you didn't date in high school. there's experiences you can only get if you dated during the time you were reading of Mice and Men. 

For instnace, I'll never be able to announce my relationship on Facebook. That's something I will never be able to do. Do you remember being announcing your relationship in 2012, and getting 60 likes on facebook? Do you remember 60 likes in 2012? That's all the likes. Obama's inauguration in 2012 got 39 likes. 
 
A facebook like in 2012 hit different. Nowadays likes don't mean anything. Nowadays a loser will get triple digit likes. I'm like a loser got 100 likes?? This guy doesn't even have 3 people that like him!

There's also perks to dating in high school. Rumors. Allegaitons.

You can be bashful about it. Nowadays its like i'm having sex in the walk-in freezer.
