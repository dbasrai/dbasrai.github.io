i didn't date in high school. and I will have my revenge.

clap your hands if you didn't date in high school ---- hey, we all still keep in touch with our english teachers.

we're underrepresented in media, you know... use who didn't date in high school. every show or movie about high schools, its just about the kids with very active dating lives. if you're a high schooler in a movie or show, you're more likely to hvae a supperpower than you are to be single. 

if you want to see the kids who aren't dating in high school, you have to look at the background of those shows. Like euphoria, right there is two hot people making out wiht each other. but if you look in the background, its 8 annoyed kids playing yugioh in the hallway.

in the front, there's peter parker sweet-talking gwen stacy. And just behind him out of focus is some guy who looks like me going 'peter can you please hop onto the google doc, the project is due tomorrow'

i didn't date in high school, and I wasn't that ready, I still did the assigned reading. oh you know the kid whos like well, I just think that sparknotes takes away a lot of the personality out of the book. yeah that kid isn't close to dating. 

but even though I didn't date, I still had these crushes, in fact, I think my feelings back in high school were the most intense they ever were, like I remember in high school,I joined Model United Nations because I was into this girl who was the treasurer.

She would be like "i think we need to caucus with albania and ghana' and I'd be like 'who... who do you ulike'. i won't tell anybody, who do you like. and she'd be like 'i don't know, i like kenya they seem pretty cool,' and i'd be like who do you 'like like'... okay nevermind I'll ask gabon if they want to join our pro-nuke coalition. 

do you guys rembmer who do you like?
that was my go-to move in high school. I didn't have the courage to ask someone out, but I was willing to over the course of months get close to someone, eventually be alone with them, ask them who they like, and they would say someone else and I'd be devastated. but then I would repeat that 50 times a school year and that would be enough for me

There were perks to dating in high school where everyone knew everyone. l wish I dated when there were rumors about you. That's a high school specific thing, when there's rumors. If you're an adult, and there's a rumor about oyu... its bad. 
In high school your crush's best friend would pull her aside and be like 'i think he has a thing for you.' nowadays her best friend will pul her aside and be like 'do you feel safe around him?

if you're an adult and there's a rumor, that's called an allegation.

i tsarted dating on the apps, and you have 0 mutual friends with these people. there's literally no one to tell. you search their full name on instagram, and they don't even show up. even instagram is like, here's 5 other people with the same name you probably should date.

but in high school, you get to announce your relationship on facebook. that might be the best itg ets. through the eons of human history, the best romance might get is in 2012, being a junior in high school, announcing your relationship on facebook, and getting 60 likes. do you guys remember what 60 likes in 2012 felt like? you feel like the greatest man alive. 60 likes in 2012--- obama's inaguration in 2012 in 38 likes.

nowadays likes don't mean anything. The hallway Yu-Gi-Oh kids are getting 3 digit likes on instagram, there's been major like inflation since 2012.

but a pure uncut 2012 like? no bots, no fashion rands, just people you respect? a like so good where you scroll through the list of people who like it and click on their profile, just to savor it?

I wish I dated in high school. Because I'm 25 and single, and I feel like I'm not ready for these mid 20s dates. This is waht I did during a recent date. We went to a cooking class, and then went to go browse a used bookstore. 

I never wanted this horeshit. 

I still want a high school relatinoship, I don't want to date a high schooler, but I still want like high school dates. I don't want to split an uber and go wine tasting, I want to walk 40 minutes to the nearest in n out, buy a neopolitan shake and share a straw.

And it just felt like dates were so much more genuine back in high school. because with a credit card and yelp you can pretend to be anyone. like when you're in your mid 20s, and at the end of a date in a dimly lit place, a dude pulls out his credit card and says he go this. that's not chivalry. that guy makes 6 figures coding an app that streamlinees indentured servitude, and his mom "helps out" a little bit. that $90 dollar check doesn't ean shit to him. Just cuz he itpped 20% doesn't mean he's a nice guy.

He just read you're supposed to do that on wikihow one day. Later tha tnight when he goes home, he's going to oder a 48 dollar doorashdash order and tip $2. 

But in high school, when you're on a date at the mall food court, and the dude says I got o tthis, and he pulls out $15 crumpled ones and $5 dollars in quarters? That guy went without eating lunch for a week to afford this meal at the mall. that's chivalry. that's love.

I really believe there's some dating experiences you can only get in high school. handjobs

4:30 pm at a suburban high school.

you should date in high school. entry level relationships. add some ex's to the resume.

graduation requirement. I think we would would be a much more empathetic and caring society if for one hour every day, we had to date another person. good-looking, not so good looking, same gender different gender, we would just be so much more open minded.

We can get rid of PE. presidential fitness test.

presidential dating test. Can you keep a conversation going for over 10 minutes. 


i hate the used book store. i like books, but i just hate these soft-spoken motherfuckers who work there. 

'have you checked out her other work,'

i still want a high school relationship. i don't want to date a high schooler, but i want high school dates. I don't want to go to a wine tasting event, i want to walk with you 40 minutes to the nearest mcdonalds, get a large shake and then share a straw. I want to get dropped off by one of our moms at the mall and both try and sit in the same massage chair. 

i am trying to date right now, but something about my vibe is that i'm mostly dating people who also didn't date in high school. so i'm going on these terrible dates, and its not like we have clashing personalities, its that we're literally bad at dating.

i know it sounds like i'm slipping on a banana peel and accidentally ripping they're dress, but geniunly some of these dates its pvery obvious we're pretty new at this. some of the eople i'm dating its like we're both doing this is just training. it feels like an entry-level job, like this isn't going to be long-term, but get some experience.i've had these brief relationships where its like oh this is just like the prwactice mode on a mario party minigame. you know, just to learn the controls. you're like should i press z and exit and they're like yeah i think i got it now.  

that's why I think kids should date in high school. just to 


 should have dated in high school. the experience. because I had my first kiss in college, adn thatw as too late. my mental image was all wrong. 

we should make it mandatory to date in high school. like a graduation requirement. We don't need PE. no ones ever had a major physical trnaspormation, and its liek what happened? PE actually. 

instead of PE we should just have an hour dating each other. stop making kids run an under-10 mile, just make em keep a conversation going for 20 minutes. 







i just turned 24, and I'm single, and I feel the clock ticking a little bit. I think I'm starting to run out of time. Before I refuse to be over 30 and single. and I have a good reason. the reason is if you're in your 30s and single, you're a little embarrassing to be around.


my advice is this, if you're over 30 and single, you should date someone, because you're making everyone around you feel a little weird. 

and i think if you're over 30 and single, that means something about you. that reflects on you in some way. I've met people in their 20s who are single, and its like you're great, it just might take some time for you to find the right person. everytime i've met someone in their 30s and single, its like oh I can see why no one loves you right now. 

and its your personality. its the inside that counts, and if you're over 30 and single, its th einside that's been rejected. you know all those things that make you you? that's what we hate.
