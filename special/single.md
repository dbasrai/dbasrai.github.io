i just turned 24, and I'm single, and I feel the clock ticking a little bit. I think I'm starting to run out of time. Before I refuse to be over 30 and single. and I have a good reason. the reason is if you're in your 30s and single, you're a little embarrassing to be around.

my advice is this, if you're over 30 and single, you should date someone, because you're making everyone around you feel a little weird. 

and i think if you're over 30 and single, that means something about you. that reflects on you in some way. I've met people in their 20s who are single, and its like you're great, it just might take some time for you to find the right person. everytime i've met someone in their 30s and single, its like oh I can see why no one loves you right now. 

and its your personality. its the inside that counts, and if you're over 30 and single, its th einside that's been rejected. you know all those things that make you you? that's what we hate. 

we should discriminate against people. like be mean to them on an individual leve, but i think it should be done systemically as well..
