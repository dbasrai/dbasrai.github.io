i didn't date in high school. and I will have my revenge.

clap your hands if you didn't date in high school ---- hey, we all still keep in touch with our english teachers.

we're underrepresented in media, you know... use who didn't date in high school. every show or movie about high schools, its just about the kids who are dating. that's the representation that matters to me. we've had like 3 brown superheroes before we've had one high schooler who isn't get his dick sucked on the reg.

if you want to see the kids who aren't dating in high school, you have to look at the background of those shows. Like euphoria, right there is two hot people making out wiht each other. but if you look in the background, its 8 annoyed kids playing yugioh in the hallway.

I wasn't ready to date in high school, I still did the assigned reading. you're not ready to date in high school if you're talking about how using sparknotes makes you miss out on the prose. 

but even though I didn't date, I still had these crushes, in fact, I think those feelings I had in high school were so much more intense than what I feel nowadays. 

Because nowadays I feel so practical about dating. It's just a time thing. Its like should cook at home more or should I date someone. But in high school I would jump through hoops just to spend more time --- just to hang out with this one girl I joined Model United Nations.

She would be like "what do you think about deploying sanctions,' and I'd be like 'who... who do you ulike''

do you remember who do you like? That was my go-to move. I would fall in love with somebody, start hanging out enough until we'd hang alone together, and then I'd go who do u like. And then she'd say someone else and I'd be devastated. And that was enough for me. That was a whole relationsnhip for me. 

i miss who do you like so much. you can't say that to a person you know nowadays. you have a crush and you're like who do you li,e and they're like... id unno fgucking stevie wonder??ot

There were perks to dating in high school where everyone knew everyone. l wish I dated when there were rumors about you. That's a high school specific thing, when there's rumors. If you're an adult, and there's a rumor about oyu... its bad. 
In high school your crush's best friend would pull her aside and be like 'i think he has a thing for you.' nowadays her best friend will pul her aside and be like 'do you feel safe around him?

if you're an adult and there's a rumor, that's called an allegation.

i tsarted dating on the apps, and you have 0 mutual friends with these people. there's literally no one to tell. you search their full name on instagram, and they don't even show up. even instagram is like, here's 5 other people with the same name you probably should date.

but in high school, you get to announce your relationship on facebook. that might be the best itg ets. through the eons of human history, the best romance might get is in 2012, being a junior in high school, announcing your relationship on facebook, and getting 60 likes. do you guys remember what 60 likes in 2012 felt like? you feel like the greatest man alive. 60 likes in 2012--- obama's inaguration in 2012 in 38 likes.

dating is so deply practical now, i want a high school relationship. i don't wantn to date a high schooler, but I want a high school relationship. My last date, this is what we did, we walked her dog, and then we went back to her place and meal prepped. not even made like a romatnic dinner, we made the food that she was going to eat later that week with a different guy she met on tinder. we put it in tupperware before we had sex. 

 I should have dated in high school. the experience. because I had my first kiss in college, adn thatw as too late. my mental image was all wrong. 

we should make it mandatory to date in high school. like a graduation requirement. We don't need PE. no ones ever had a major physical trnaspormation, and its liek what happened? PE actually. 

instead of PE we should just have an hour dating each other. stop making kids run an under-10 mile, just make em keep a conversation going for 20 minutes. 







i just turned 24, and I'm single, and I feel the clock ticking a little bit. I think I'm starting to run out of time. Before I refuse to be over 30 and single. and I have a good reason. the reason is if you're in your 30s and single, you're a little embarrassing to be around.


my advice is this, if you're over 30 and single, you should date someone, because you're making everyone around you feel a little weird. 

and i think if you're over 30 and single, that means something about you. that reflects on you in some way. I've met people in their 20s who are single, and its like you're great, it just might take some time for you to find the right person. everytime i've met someone in their 30s and single, its like oh I can see why no one loves you right now. 

and its your personality. its the inside that counts, and if you're over 30 and single, its th einside that's been rejected. you know all those things that make you you? that's what we hate.
