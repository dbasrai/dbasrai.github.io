i didn't date in high school. and I will have my revenge.

clap your hands if you didn't date in high school ---- hey, we all still keep in touch with our english teachers.

we're underrepresented in media, you know... use who didn't date in high school. every show or movie about high schools, its just about the kids with very active dating lives. if you're a high schooler in a movie or show, you're more likely to hvae a supperpower than you are to be single. 

if you want to see the kids who aren't dating in high school, you have to look at the background of those shows. Like euphoria, right there is two hot people making out wiht each other. but if you look in the background, its 8 annoyed kids playing yugioh in the hallway.

in the front, there's peter parker sweet-talking gwen stacy. And just behind him out of focus is some guy who looks like me going 'peter can you please hop onto the google doc, the project is due tomorrow'

i didn't date in high school, and I wasn't that ready, I still did the assigned reading. oh you know the kid whos like well, I just think that sparknotes takes away a lot of the personality out of the book. yeah that kid isn't close to dating. 

but even though I didn't date, I still had these crushes, in fact, I think my feelings back in high school were the most intense they ever were, like I remember in high school,I joined Model United Nations because I was into this girl who was the treasurer.

She would be like "i think we need to caucus with albania and ghana' and I'd be like 'who... who do you ulike'. i won't tell anybody, who do you like. and she'd be like 'i don't know, i like kenya they seem pretty cool,' and i'd be like who do you 'like like'... okay nevermind I'll ask gabon if they want to join our pro-nuke coalition. 

do you guys rembmer who do you like?
that was my go-to move in high school. I didn't have the courage to ask someone out, but I was willing to over the course of months get close to someone, eventually be alone with them, ask them who they like, and they would say someone else and I'd be devastated. but then I would repeat that 50 times a school year and that would be enough for me

but that's how powerful my crushes were, i became secretary of model un just to be close to this lady. i'd record meeting minutes like 'the vice president called the meeting to order, in a delicate but firm voice. the next order of business was i think she looked at me. i think she took a glance.'

that's how all high school cabinet positions were, just people joining because they had a thing for somebody in there. I became secretary to have a chance with the treasurer, who in turn was there to get in the pants of the vice president.

i would love if the cabinet of the united states was like this? like pete buttigieg only became secretary of transportation because he had a thing for secretary of state anthony blinken, who in turn always was nurisng a crush on kamala. 

There were perks to dating in high school where everyone knew everyone. l wish I dated when there were rumors about you. That's a high school specific thing, when there's rumors. If you're an adult, and there's a rumor about oyu... its bad. 
In high school your crush's best friend would pull her aside and be like 'i think he has a thing for you.' nowadays her best friend will pul her aside and be like 'do you feel safe around him?

if you're an adult and there's a rumor, that's called an allegation.

i tsarted dating on the apps, and you have 0 mutual friends with these people. there's literally no one to tell. you search their full name on instagram, and they don't even show up. even instagram is like, here's 5 other people with the same name you probably should date.

but in high school, you get to announce your relationship on facebook. that might be the best itg ets. through the eons of human history, the best romance might get is in 2012, being a junior in high school, announcing your relationship on facebook, and getting 60 likes. do you guys remember what 60 likes in 2012 felt like? you feel like the greatest man alive. 60 likes in 2012--- obama's inaguration in 2012 in 38 likes.

nowadays likes don't mean anything. The hallway Yu-Gi-Oh kids are getting 3 digit likes on instagram, there's been major like inflation since 2012.

but a pure uncut 2012 like? no bots, no fashion rands, just people you respect? a like so good where you scroll through the list of people who like it and click on their profile, just to savor it?

i really feel like I missed out on stuff because I didn't date in high school. I really think there is a charm to high school dates. The actual dates you go on in your 20s are very different than what you did in high school. Like my last date a couple weeks ago, this is what we did. We went to a cooking class, and then we went to a used bookstore and bought each other books.

I never wanted this horeshit. 

i hate the used book store. i like books, but i just hate these soft-spoken motherfuckers who work there. 

'have you checked out her other work,'

i still want a high school relationship. i don't want to date a high schooler, but i want high school dates. I don't want to go to a wine tasting event, i want to walk with you 40 minutes to the nearest mcdonalds, get a large shake and then share a straw. I want to get dropped off by one of our moms at the mall and both try and sit in the same massage chair. 




 should have dated in high school. the experience. because I had my first kiss in college, adn thatw as too late. my mental image was all wrong. 

we should make it mandatory to date in high school. like a graduation requirement. We don't need PE. no ones ever had a major physical trnaspormation, and its liek what happened? PE actually. 

instead of PE we should just have an hour dating each other. stop making kids run an under-10 mile, just make em keep a conversation going for 20 minutes. 







i just turned 24, and I'm single, and I feel the clock ticking a little bit. I think I'm starting to run out of time. Before I refuse to be over 30 and single. and I have a good reason. the reason is if you're in your 30s and single, you're a little embarrassing to be around.


my advice is this, if you're over 30 and single, you should date someone, because you're making everyone around you feel a little weird. 

and i think if you're over 30 and single, that means something about you. that reflects on you in some way. I've met people in their 20s who are single, and its like you're great, it just might take some time for you to find the right person. everytime i've met someone in their 30s and single, its like oh I can see why no one loves you right now. 

and its your personality. its the inside that counts, and if you're over 30 and single, its th einside that's been rejected. you know all those things that make you you? that's what we hate.
