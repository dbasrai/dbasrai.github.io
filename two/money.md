# money

i have a day job, i make the median income in ILlinois. authorized personnel, I just walk through it as many times cuz it feels cool. YOu get to scan a badge and get paid minimum wage. ddI have to fill out all these security clearance shit. Can you imagine making just about minimum wage and having to fill out security clearances? Security clearnces should be the salaary of the place eyou work. 



--i  was in the ER recently. I have pretty good insurance. I like when they cross the numbers out for you. i get to scan a badge to get into my work. I love it so much. Its really not hard to get a badge for somehting. They kinda just give you one on the first day. When I wa sa kid I was so impressed when somebody had a badge to something. I scan a badge and get to walk into an authorized personnel building, just like in the movies. They pay me minimum wage. Authorized personnel and secureity clearances. 

its crazy that you cana make only $3000 a month and be able to to be considdrred autyhorized personnel. usually things are as partonizing as the employees must wash handns sign.

--i make $3000 a month. anyone here make less than me. its pretty good, turns out $3000 a month is actually considdered upper class in war-torn sudan.
