# anxiety

I've never been to a real-life, in-person therapist before but I have been dabbling around with online gambling. 

No, I have been trying to use those online therapy services one free trial at a time. I have this weird thing where every time they ask me a personal question I slam my laptop shut. Which makes me feel better.So its working.

There's just so much maintainance in my life rihgt now. 

I have nothing against going to therapy, I think it's healthy and my insurance.... (misdirect?).

It's just that I feel like I have so many appoointments already in my life. I need to make dentist appointments, car appoinments, physical therapy for my bum shoulder... it's just like I need two root canals before a therapist. 

That's what I realize, is for most of us, you gotta choose what's getting fixed. Like, I think you have to be either a dentist person or a therapist person. Every person with great mental health hasn't been to a dentist in 4 years, like we only have so many hours after 5pm when we get home from work, like you gotta decide whether you want anxiety or cavities.

Like, you're either a dentist person or a therapist person, and I'm an optometrist person. That's my go-to, my prescriptions are up to date. 

I just don't know how we're expected to have jobs, relationships, workout, and also make our appointments. You know how there's mexican places that have tacos and burgers? We really need that for mental health professionals. 

Like I want to go get a haircut and have them look at some my moles. Or go to a car mechanic and they ask how my relationship with my parents is going. 

I just think we need more low-skill workers. Not more low-skill jobs, but like people who are low skill at their job. Like I don't need a specialist. I just need someone who's like... watched all of House. I just don't want to get what someone in house has. 

Its odd that we don't have mental health physicals. Like every 6 months I'm supposed to go to a doctor, who's gonna cup my balls and make me cough, and apparently getting full blown testicular cancer is more likely than having a mental health thing. 

Do you think that modern technology, like cellphones, social media, the internet cause mental health problems. Like, surveys show that mental health issues are highest amongst young people, but who's taking surveys? If you're filling out a survevy, I think that already means you're having a terrible time. If you're filling out a 5-page questionairre for a $10 amazon gift card, it doesn't surprise me that you "somewhat agree" you have had negative feelings in the past 6 months. 

I really think that filling out surveys is hitting rock bottom. Every poll is like 2 in 3 teenagers have suicidal thoughts, and its like I don't think 2 and 3 teenagers are suicidal, I think 2 out of 3 teenagers filling out a form by the bureau of labor statistics, I think they for sure want to kill themselve.

My dad always says technology makes us run out of dopamine. He goes so dopamine is the happiness drug, and you keep using your phone to get more dopamine, and that's bad, because you run out of happy. I hate when people etalk about dopamine. It's the adult version of the kids in elementary school who used to say they're gonna have a glass of h2o. 

I think nowadays we're better at noticing when we have mental health issues. My mom doesn't think she has anxiety, she just thinks the house is under constant threat of home invasion. 

breaking and entering. 

Have you taken any of these surveys, they might actually be what's causing anxiety. Every question will be like the ocean is collapsing, is this least concern or somewhat concern. 

I think like a lot of things, mental health is a spectrum, but I think we don't like spectrums, we like to categorize things . I think that's a very human quality. People will be like neurodivergence is a spectrum, its not just neurodivergent or neurotypical, and immediately we were like, it sounds like that guys on the espectrum. I'm off thte spectrum. THat's not how spectrums work.
