# anxiety

Do you think that modern technology, like cellphones, social media, the internet cause mental health problems. Like, surveys show that mental health issues are highest amongst young people, but who's taking surveys? If you're filling out a survevy, I think that already means you're having a terrible time. If you're filling out a 5-page questionairre for a $10 amazon gift card, it doesn't surprise me that you "somewhat agree" you have had negative feelings in the past 6 months. 

I really think that filling out surveys is hitting rock bottom. Every poll is like 2 in 3 teenagers have suicidal thoughts, and its like I don't think 2 and 3 teenagers are suicidal, I think 2 out of 3 teenagers filling out a form by the bureau of labor statistics, I think they for sure want to kill themselve.

My dad always says technology makes us run out of dopamine. He goes so dopamine is the happiness drug, and you keep using your phone to get more dopamine, and that's bad, because you run out of happy. I hate when people etalk about dopamine. It's the adult version of the kids in elementary school who used to say they're gonna have a glass of h2o. 

I think nowadays we're better at noticing when we have mental health issues. My mom doesn't think she has anxiety, she just thinks the house is under constant threat of home invasion.

Have you taken any of these surveys, they might actually be what's causing anxiety. Every question will be like the ocean is collapsing, is this least concern or somewhat concern. 

I think like a lot of things, mental health is a spectrum, but I think we don't like spectrums, we like to categorize things . I think that's a very human quality. People will be like neurodivergence is a spectrum, its not just neurodivergent or neurotypical, and immediately we were like, it sounds like that guys on the espectrum. I'm off thte spectrum. THat's not how spectrums work.
