# climate

I've been worried about climate change recently. I'm trying to do my part, I've been driving around in eco mode. Every night before I sleep, I'll drive a few miles in eco mode, you know, just to try and make the world a better place. Its expensive, you know, my Ford F-150 has terrible gas mileage, but we've all gotta make sacrifices.

If you don't know what eco mode is, nobody does, but there is a green leaf icon next to it. I'm only doing things with a green leaf beside it, im running my washer all the time, I order door dash 3 times a day with no utensils, I use my own plastic utensils at home, . 

america loves to solve problems by adding different modes to things, like we're like 3 years away from trying to curb gun violence by adding reduced-impact mode to guns. 

i realize now its not gonna be like the apocolapyse films where there's a sudden transition into the apocolaypse, its going to be this slow gradual transition. like in the movies, the entire world gets plunged into apocolaypse, but for us, its going to spread region by region. Like I wonder if all these apocolaypse films are just about LA, but the rest of the world is still okay. Like in Mad Max, you have all Imortan Joe's war boys driving these souped up cars around this wasteland, and there's like there's marauders in the stormlands, and to the east that's regular Minneapolis. If we can escape we can go catch a timberwolves game. 

by the way those cars the war boys are driving, those are acutally all in eco mode right now.

I think we're just gonna keep making small changes until the climate change apocolapyse. Llike the moies really only show the big wasteland, but really we're going to try and improve the world. Like in Mad Max, you have all the war boys driving around these cars, but all those cars are actually in eco mode. we're going to have a wasteland full of reusable bags, carbon offset things, composting bins,  

also in the movies its like the entire country becomes wasteland, but its clear it'll spread bit by bit. Like I wonder in Mad Max if that's just LA. Like, they're like we have the War Boys in the South, the Marauders patroll the western teritories, and to the North, well there's regular Minneapolis. Tom Hardy is like if we take control of the train, and we head North, we can go and catch a Timberwolves game.

at least in the apocolapyse, you just have to worry about food, water, survivors, bandits, but the problem when it is a slow transition is that we'll also have our regular people problems. We're gonna be in the apocolaypse like there's been bandit sightings in the North and tomorrow's street sweeping so we've gotta repark our car.

we're still gonna have insurance? (CALLBACK HERE)

I've gotta say climate change its bad timing for me. People my age, in our early 20s, the issue is we're gonna be here for the beginning when shit goes down. We're gonna be old during the apocolapyse.  This is a mid 20s problem by the way, if you're over 30, you're gonna be long dead. Enjoy the running water bro.

But we're gonna be old during the apocolayps.e We're gnona have to tell people stories of the before times... we're gonna have to tell people stories like when Ellen used to be liked. (pop culture bullshit here).

I also don't want to be an old person because we're gonna have to sacrifice ourselves for the greater good. During the apocolaypse, the #1 cause of death for old people is "save yourself, go on without me."

We're also gonna have memories of how things were before. There's always this scene where the protagonist is losing hope, and he'll flashback to the good times, like in Mad Max, Max is always being attakced and about to lose hope, and he'll flashback to the good times, he'll flashback to him having sex with his hot wife, and that'll give him the strength to keep going.

You know what the fucked up part i? These are our good times right now. This is the best it gets for us. kkkkk




carbon foot print.

people are always talking about the climate change apocolapyse, but its gonna  

mad max wasteland, there's the war boys conntrolling the soutehr corridor, and the ... and there's regular Minneapolis.

by the way those cars in mad max, those are all in eco mode. 

that taco bell kiosk is wall-e, its going to fall in love with a robot.



The climate is probably gonna change, and I'm trying to get ready for it by watcvhing apocolaypse movies. I've been watching I Am Legend. That's when I realize it's gonna be a gradual transiton, instad of a .

do you guys think this climate change thing will blow over? I've been driving in eco mode

i've only heard of the national guard stopping black people from protesting. 

they made it so that they put a leaf in places where you can really fuck up the environment. Brother go to any oil refinery, there's a leaf symbol mod.

We invented eco mode. we're going to destroy the world with eco mode. we're gonna drop a nuke and its gonna be like sports mode or eco mode. 

it more effectively uses energy dumping landfill into the ocean.

no actually looked up what eco omde. it stands fr. might get rescused from the apocolaypse by the military, they're working on the cure.
