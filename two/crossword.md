# military

US spends 900 billion dollars on the military every year. 900 billion. If you want to grasp how big 900 billion dollars, imagine if I had a baby every day for a year.... 900 billion its a pretty big fucking number.

Anyway the US spends more on the military than every other country in the world combined, which is the war we should have. US vs the world? 

Before we even bring up the discussion whetehr that money would be better spent elswhere, you have to admit, we're not good for 900 billion. Like we have a godo military, but we're not 900 billion good.
