# military

I don't really know what our military is up to.... I don't really know whow what they're doing in those country. I do know they have a lot of moeny...

We spend 900 billion dollars on the military every year, and I have to say, I don' tthink we'reve to admit, we're not good for 900 billion. Like we have a godo military, but we're not 900 billion good.

Like, I don't really know anything aobut the military, but there's no way that's worth 900 billion.
