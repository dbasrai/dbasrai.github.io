...proves their god isn't real. 

But it's an important job. I enter work through an authorized personnel only door. That's right, I'm Authorized Personnel Only. It's a big step up for for me, my previous security clearnce was Employees Must Wash Hands in Hot Water. 

By the way, did you guys know that you can be authorized personnel and make $35,000 a year. We're authorizing anybody now. When I was a kid, I thought authorized personnel were like the people behind the scenes, making sure the country ran smoothly. But no, look behind any auuthorized personnel door. It's just me behind that door, being shit at my job. 

Here's what I do at work. I fuck up and don't tell anybody. Which is not good when you work in science. Like, there's always been this lack of public faith in science... evolution/germtheory/male g spot.

I'm shit at my job, but I think most of us are kinda shit at our jobs. Because here, you have to work to survive, not in what you're interested in or good at. Like, I was bad in science in high school, and now I make your vacccines, and I didn't even have a life-changing event, like I think I would still do bad in high school science.


I do think that's the heart of every single conspiracy theory, is someone fucking up at work and not telling someone. Even 9/11, you know how people are like jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams, I bet what actually happened was that after the world trade center was constructed, some architectural firm was like they wanted steal beams? Well I don't think it makes a difference as long as they don't get 9/11ed.

science is focused on creating things that allow us to work more. 

People who make AI are also dogshit at their jobs. Have you seen the fast food kiosk. 

95% of people you went to high school with are working? 

Everytime a Boeing Plane crashes, that's because everybody's gotta work.
