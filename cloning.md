# Cloning

Here, I will discuss the technical stuff behind cloning for the post-production sketch. 

I wanted just a simple composite shot, so I put a tripod down and filmed myself twice walking down the street. I had the cameraguy count outloud throughout the whole thing in order to get the timing correct, and had myself pull out the phone on a certain beat.

Ideally, and the original intention was to actually do a cloning shot with a switch in depth of focus. Namely, have the focus be on me in the foregorund, then the focus switches to me and the background. This would have been more technical and would have required replicating the focus in both shots and at the exact same timing. Eventually I gave this up just to do a simple cloning shot. 

In editing, I used After Effects to track myself in the foreground and mask myself out. I used a simple elipse mask and tracked it over my face, and luckily, the other me never walked in front of myself, so the mask was simple and the after effects built in tracking was good enough so I didn't have to do anything more complex. I ran into some issues where I pulled my phone out in the foreground and it interfered a bit with the background, but I fixed it by just putting a second tiny mask over the phone itself. 

Later, I did a shot where I put together two shots, with the camera on me and then swish panning to myself sitting at the table. I did this simply by swish panning twice, one with me at the door and one with me at the table, and cutting them together during the fast motion fo the camera.
