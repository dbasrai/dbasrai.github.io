<p>Hi, my name is Diya Basrai, I'm a Chicago-based comic. This is the online "textbook" accompanying the stand-up 101 course I'm teaching at Revival Theater. While the in-person course is best suited for someone who has never performed stand-up before and has ~$300, this textbook is a compilation of my thoughts, examples, and opinions accompanying each lesson that is hopefully interesting to comics of all levels.</p>
<h1 id="layout"><a class="header" href="#layout">Layout</a></h1>
<p>The numbered weeks correspond to each week's class in an 8-week class. The Basics page contains useful advice for new comics, such as terminology and guides for entering a scene. The Chicago Resources page contains useful links for Chicago comics.</p>

<h2 id="course-overview"><a class="header" href="#course-overview">Course Overview</a></h2>
<p>Lesson 1 is about premises.</p>
<p>Lesson 2 covers the principles of joke structure.</p>
<p>Lesson 3 focuses on basis of performing.</p>
<p>Lesson 4 is about bombing.</p>
<p>Lesson 5 guides editing and refining.</p>
<p>Lesson 6 is reserved for parent teacher conferences.</p>
<p>Lesson 7 is about finding your voice.</p>
<h2 id="lesson-overview"><a class="header" href="#lesson-overview">Lesson Overview</a></h2>
<p>Each lesson, we'll start by having some people pitch some jokes they wrote over the past week.</p>
<p>Then, I'll go over the material of the week, albeit in a more discussion-based manner.</p>
<p>Peppered in throughout, we'll break into small groups and do some of the listed group exercises.</p>
<p><em>It is highly encouraged to read through the weeks write-up here prior to coming to class, and watch the embedded clips.</em></p>
<h2 id="assignments"><a class="header" href="#assignments">Assignments</a></h2>
<h3 id="weekly-assignments"><a class="header" href="#weekly-assignments">Weekly Assignments</a></h3>
<p>Students are asked to 1) Write one joke, and 2) Do one of the assigments listed at the end of the week's page.</p>
<h3 id="course-assignments"><a class="header" href="#course-assignments">Course Assignments</a></h3>
<p>Over the 8 weeks, I also ask that every student attends 1 show and 1 open mic. See the show and open mic list for suggestions.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="premises"><a class="header" href="#premises">Premises</a></h1>
<p>When sitting down to write a joke for the first time, a lot of new comics rack their brains to try and think of something funny. Which is logical. But its hard to generate something funny out of thin air, and I think can lead to converge on topics that are "intrinsically" funny like sex and bodily excretions.</p>
<p>Instead, I'd suggest focusing on finding a premise first, and then writing around that. A premise is the broad term for an idea or angle driving a joke. For a more specific definition which will have exceptions, I'd say a premise is an interesting opinion that needs to be justified or explained. Importantly, premises do not necessarily have to be funny... just interesting. The funny part comes after. Lets ground in some examples.</p>
<h2 id="obervations"><a class="header" href="#obervations">Obervations</a></h2>
<p>In observational comedy, the premise is generally an observation of something commonplace that you think is odd, or weird, or some other emotion.</p>
<video width="100%" height="auto" controls loop>
  <source src="./media/week1/laurapeek_foreign.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video> 
<p>In this great Laura Peek joke, the premise is that it is odd that woman's bathrooms say no "foreign" objects. That is the main idea behind the joke, and the funny comes from various examples. Again, the observation of the word "foreign" isn't funny in itself, but it is interesting and can be explained.</p>
<p>In some cases, the premise is pretty inseparable from the joke itself. In this Louis Katz bit, the premise that NYE has the worst parts of all the other holidays is pretty much a step away from the joke... but note that it still needs to be explained through example. If your premise is JUST the joke, you rarely have somewhere to go.</p>
<video width="100%" height="auto" controls loop>
  <source src="./media/week1/louiekatz_nye.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video> 
<p>A pure observational joke like these can be difficult. There's a lot of people trying to be funny on the internet, and with how easy it is to post a joke on twitter or a front-facing reel on Instagram, most of the mid-to-low hanging fruit have been plucked. When trying to come up with observations, sometimes looking at things that have changed in the last decade, without necessarily being "news-cycle topical", is more ripe for an original idea.</p>
<video width="100%" height="auto" controls loop>
  <source src="./media/week1/jamesacaster_they.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video> 
<h2 id="takes"><a class="header" href="#takes">Takes</a></h2>
<p>Other types of jokes with readily apparent premises are "takes," or just strong, sometimes controversial opinions that need to be justified. Again, the takes themselves do not have to be funny. In this joke by Gastor Almonte, his overaching premise that oatmeal is bad isn't necessary funny... its in his reasoning where the humor comes.</p>
<video width="100%" height="auto" controls loop>
  <source src="./media/week1/gastoralmonte_oatmeal.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video> 
<p>Another good example is Maddie Wiener explaining why plus-sized models aren't relatable to regular plus-sized people.</p>
<video width="100%" height="auto" controls loop>
  <source src="./media/week1/maddiewiener_richfat.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video> 
<p>Again, the joke is largely driven by an interesting idea/take, that perhaps in itself isn't "funny."</p>
<h2 id="personal"><a class="header" href="#personal">Personal</a></h2>
<p>I am largely using the word "interesting" to describe premises that can be mined for jokes, but its not easy to have a good intuition for what is interesting. One clue that a premise is interesting is that it is based on a personal situation, but can be made into a more general statement.</p>
<p>In this Mekki Leeper, he starts off with the highly specific story that his GF left him for a basketball player. But I think he is effective at generalizing it to the general odd feeling of your GF leaving you for someone "better".</p>

<p>This is a general guide for someone wanting to perform stand-up tonight. We start in your house, we end back there way too late.</p>
<h1 id="picking-an-open-mic"><a class="header" href="#picking-an-open-mic">Picking an open mic</a></h1>
<p>Great, you want to do an open mic tonight. First, pick one out. For Chicago folks, an incomplete list is here[^1]. Each mic is different --- some are well-attended by non-comics, others by barely anyone. Depending on how sign-up works and how many comics attend, each has different amounts of waiting before you go up. Some mics suck, some are good, but mostly you have to go to em and decide for yourself what you prefer.</p>
<h1 id="open-mic-sign-ups"><a class="header" href="#open-mic-sign-ups">Open Mic sign-ups</a></h1>
<p>Here are the common ways open mics sign-up works.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>"Show up go up" usually means in-person sign ups at a predetermined time (most commonly half an hour before the actual start time). Reach out and ask if sign-up time isn't clearly indicated. People usually arrive earlier than the actual sign-up since there's almost always the implicit rule of sign-up in the order you got there. You kinda have to start going to figure out what time you should actually show up to get the spot you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Lottery" or "bucket" usually has you write your name on a slip of paper and throw it in a receptacle of some sort. Thus, its "random" order --- how long you arrived before sign-up doesn't affect your spot. There's many variations on this, so you have to go to a specific mic to see how its actually done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Pre-signups" or "booked mics," usually has some method of filling slots prior to sign-up, either through online sign-ups, submissions, etc. Usually for mics with limited number of slots.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="during-the-mic"><a class="header" href="#during-the-mic">During the mic</a></h1>
<p>Note whether there's any item minimum required for the mic. It's generally good practice if you can afford it to grab a drink of some sort to support the venue, a water and a dollar tip also absolves any guilt or sin if you're on a budget.</p>
<p>After signing up, I'd suggest taking a picture of the list. Its a little bothersome to lose track of when you are, and hosts can be miffy if you repeatedly ask to recheck the list.</p>
<p>I'd always suggest newer comics watching as much as they can stand. After performing, I'd always stay for at least one person after you. After that, support the comics after as much as makes sense for yourself.</p>
<h1 id="after-the-mic"><a class="header" href="#after-the-mic">After the mic</a></h1>
<p>Thank the host before you leave.</p>
