<p>Hi, my name is Diya Basrai, I'm a Chicago-based comic. This is the online "textbook" accompanying the stand-up 101 course I'm teaching at Revival Theater.</p>
<p>The purpose of this class is to set-up students to dive in the local open mic scene. Over 8 weeks, we go through the basics of building a tight five minute set, from concrete technical principles of jokewriting to more abstract concepts about finding your voice. This textbook also tries to provide practical advice to navigate the local scene, some suggestions universal and others specific to Chicago. For instance, the "Basics" section tries to articulate some rules that are usually explained only when violated.</p>
<h1 id="layout"><a class="header" href="#layout">Layout</a></h1>
<p>The numbered weeks correspond to each week's class in an 8-week class. The Basics page contains useful advice for new comics, such as terminology and guides for entering a scene. The Chicago Resources page contains useful links for Chicago comics</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="purpose"><a class="header" href="#purpose">Purpose</a></h1>
<p>The purpose of this class is to build a 5-minute set, which is the ticket to perform at any open mic. The class is comprised of 8 lessons that will provide ideas and exercises to guide crafting these 5 minutes. The first 4 lessons are built around generating the intial 5 minutes, and the last 4 lessons are built around performing it and refining it.</p>
<p>In practicality, I think nothing in this book will be as useful as sitting down a weekend, banging out ~5 minutes of jokes, then going to an open mic and performing it. But I realize performing is intimidating, so hopefully the next few lessons will give something to grasp at to get the confidence to start hitting the mics. But the minute you feel like you'd survive, get out there!</p>
<h1 id="outline"><a class="header" href="#outline">Outline</a></h1>
<p>Lesson 1 is about being yourself. We look at Dusty Slay, Jo Firestone, and Gary Gulman sets.</p>
<p>Lesson 2 focuses on the principles of joke structure. We look at Laurie Kilmartin and Dan Mintz sets in whole, and a lot, lot of clips.</p>
<p>Lesson 3 focuses on set structure.</p>
<p>Lesson 4 focuses on performance and presence.</p>
<p>Lesson 5 focuses on editing and refining.</p>
<p>Lesson 6 focuses on interacting (implicitly and explicitly) with the crowdw.</p>
<p>Lesson 7 focuses on context, what does it mean to do stand-up in 2024.</p>
<p>Lesson 8 we return to yourself, and think about your voice.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="be-yourself-up-there"><a class="header" href="#be-yourself-up-there">Be Yourself Up There</a></h1>
<p>Great sets radiate the comedian's personality and ideas. The best punchlines hit not only because they're well-crafted, but because they simultaneously perfectly capture a comedian's unique sense of humor and worldview. With just a few concise lines, the audience suddenly sees the world from the eyes of whoever is on stage... and this is what makes jokes hit hardest.</p>
<p>The next 6 lessons give guidelines and exercises to learn technical writing and sharp performance. The real tragedy is that these skills can sometimes pull the comedian away from talking about something they actually care about and find funny. Sometimes technique obfuscates who the comedian really is as a person, which renders the stand-up meaningless, or worse, unfunny.</p>
<p>Everything about stand-up has to bleed you. The more "you" that permeates every idea, word, pause... the harder the jokes will hit.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, I'd return to this question: "am I being myself up there?"</p>
<h2 id="audience-assumptions"><a class="header" href="#audience-assumptions">Audience assumptions</a></h2>
<p>The Tonight Show infrequently features stand-up comedians, and when they do, they're usually quite famous. Ever so often, they feature an up and comer, someone who the audience probably doesn't know. This is the context of which you'll most likely always go up with.</p>
<p>The comedian must explain who they are. My favorite sets are the ones who do so in the comedy equivalent of "showing, not telling." They don't say who they are, their subject matter, their logic, their dress, their cadence make it clear.</p>
<p>Dusty Slay, a comic largely unknown when they debuted on the Tonight Show, nails this.</p>
<video width="100%" height="auto" controls loop>
  <source src="./media/dusty.webm" type="video/webm">
</video> 
<p>Use this set to think about audience assumptions. Which jokes  does Dusty explicitely address audience assumptions? Does he undermine these assumptions or lean into them? At what points does he rely on implicit assumptions?</p>
<h2 id="activity"><a class="header" href="#activity">Activity</a></h2>
<p>Write 4 facts about yourself.2 facts "make sense," that is, wouldn't be completely out of the blue to a person that sees you for the first time. 2 facts should be surprising. Chat about why each fact falls into each category. Confirm that your assumptions about which are surprising and which are unsurprising are correct.</p>
<h2 id="find-the-latent-assumptions"><a class="header" href="#find-the-latent-assumptions">Find the "latent" assumptions</a></h2>
<p>Simply addressing assumptions can get hack<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">1</a></sup> quickly. It's hard to have a "I know what you're thinking... I look like BLANK had sex with BLANK" that is funny. Instead, find the "latent" assumptions, the assumptions that sit in the audiences subconscious that they only realize once you utter it.</p>
<p>Jo Firestone is quite good at this:</p>
<video width="100%" height="auto" controls loop>
  <source src="./media/jo.webm" type="video/webm">
</video> 
<p>Which are the "latent" assumptions that Jo addresses? How does it toe the line between being too "obvious" and not really capturing the audience assumption?</p>
<h2 id="activity-1"><a class="header" href="#activity-1">Activity</a></h2>
<p>These latent assumptions are hard to discover, and usually only come up during brief moments of inspiration or a loved one being rude to me. A little trick that can get closer to this is to take an obvious assumption, then come up with a habit/thing/task that a person fulfilling that assumption usually does, and jump straight to there. Matt Lockwood, an LA comic, has a great line where he goes "people always think I get my foot stuck in a lot of buckets." [^3]</p>
<p>Take the 2 facts that "make sense," and come up with an additional habit/stereotype/assumption/etc. about that fact. Can you possibly go straight to "I know I look like I do BLANK?"</p>
<h2 id="subject-matter"><a class="header" href="#subject-matter">Subject matter</a></h2>
<p>Enough about the audience and their assumptions. You're on stage, you also have the power to guide and shape what they think about you.</p>
<p>Most fundamental to the audience understanding who you are is your subject matter, the very premises of your jokes. Lets start by watching one of the most famous late-night sets by Gary Gulman.</p>
<video width="100%" height="auto" controls loop>
  <source src="./media/gary.webm" type="video/webm">
</video> 
<p>Over the set, did you get a picture of who Gary "is?" What about his premises, language, style did so?</p>
<h2 id="activity-2"><a class="header" href="#activity-2">Activity</a></h2>
<p>Remember a moment you felt funny. It can be something said to a friend, something typed onto a work Microsoft Teams chat, something said to yourself while you were stoned at home.</p>
<p>Think about why it was funny. Was it a clever line? Was it funny because it was just the perfect line for the context? Was it funny because you're normally quiet? Etc.</p>
<p>Write it down.</p>

<p>This is a general guide for someone wanting to perform stand-up tonight. We start in your house, we end back there way too late.</p>
<h1 id="picking-an-open-mic"><a class="header" href="#picking-an-open-mic">Picking an open mic</a></h1>
<p>Great, you want to do an open mic tonight. First, pick one out. For Chicago folks, an incomplete list is here[^1]. Each mic is different --- some are well-attended by non-comics, others by barely anyone. Depending on how sign-up works and how many comics attend, each has different amounts of waiting before you go up. Some mics suck, some are good, but mostly you have to go to em and decide for yourself what you prefer.</p>
<h1 id="open-mic-sign-ups"><a class="header" href="#open-mic-sign-ups">Open Mic sign-ups</a></h1>
<p>Here are the common ways open mics sign-up works.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>"Show up go up" usually means in-person sign ups at a predetermined time (most commonly half an hour before the actual start time). Reach out and ask if sign-up time isn't clearly indicated. People usually arrive earlier than the actual sign-up since there's almost always the implicit rule of sign-up in the order you got there. You kinda have to start going to figure out what time you should actually show up to get the spot you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Lottery" or "bucket" usually has you write your name on a slip of paper and throw it in a receptacle of some sort. Thus, its "random" order --- how long you arrived before sign-up doesn't affect your spot. There's many variations on this, so you have to go to a specific mic to see how its actually done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Pre-signups" or "booked mics," usually has some method of filling slots prior to sign-up, either through online sign-ups, submissions, etc. Usually for mics with limited number of slots.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="during-the-mic"><a class="header" href="#during-the-mic">During the mic</a></h1>
<p>Note whether there's any item minimum required for the mic. It's generally good practice if you can afford it to grab a drink of some sort to support the venue, a water and a dollar tip also absolves any guilt or sin if you're on a budget.</p>
<p>After signing up, I'd suggest taking a picture of the list. Its a little bothersome to lose track of when you are, and hosts can be miffy if you repeatedly ask to recheck the list.</p>
<p>I'd always suggest newer comics watching as much as they can stand. After performing, I'd always stay for at least one person after you. After that, support the comics after as much as makes sense for yourself.</p>
