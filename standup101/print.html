<p>Hi, my name is Diya Basrai, I'm a Chicago-based comic. This is the online "textbook" accompanying the stand-up 101 course I'm teaching at Revival Theater. The course is best suited for someone who has never performed stand-up before, but perhaps could be useful for those who are experienced but untalented.</p>
<p>Overall, this textbook covers the material, in-class exercises, and at-home assignments given during the in-person course. While mainly useful for those taking the course, I have some hope there are some interesting ideas for any comic who stumbles across this link. I've also tried to add a little practical advice on how to navigate the local scene, some suggestions universal and others specific to Chicago.</p>
<h1 id="layout"><a class="header" href="#layout">Layout</a></h1>
<p>The numbered weeks correspond to each week's class in an 8-week class. The Basics page contains useful advice for new comics, such as terminology and guides for entering a scene. The Chicago Resources page contains useful links for Chicago comics.</p>

<h2 id="course-overview"><a class="header" href="#course-overview">Course Overview</a></h2>
<p>Lesson 1 is about being yourself.</p>
<p>Lesson 2 covers the principles of joke structure.</p>
<p>Lesson 3 focuses on opening strong, as well as performance basics. In-class we will have our first WORKSHOP, where students will perform 2-3 minutes of jokes to each other and give feedback.</p>
<p>Lesson 4 is about bombing.</p>
<p>Lesson 5 focuses on editing and refining.</p>
<p>Lesson 6 is reserved for parent teacher conferences. In-class we will have our second WORKSHOP.</p>
<p>Lesson 7 is about finding your voice.</p>
<p>Lesson 8 is a third workshop.</p>
<h2 id="lesson-overview"><a class="header" href="#lesson-overview">Lesson Overview</a></h2>
<p>Each lesson, we'll start by having some people pitch some jokes they wrote over the past week.</p>
<p>Then, I'll go over the material of the week, albeit in a more discussion-based manner.</p>
<p>Peppered in throughout, we'll break into small groups and do some of the listed group exercises.</p>
<p><em>It is highly encouraged to read through the weeks write-up here prior to coming to class, and watch the embedded clips.</em></p>
<h2 id="assignments"><a class="header" href="#assignments">Assignments</a></h2>
<h3 id="weekly-assignments"><a class="header" href="#weekly-assignments">Weekly Assignments</a></h3>
<p>Students are asked to 1) Write one joke, and 2) Do one of the assigments listed at the end of the week's page.</p>
<h3 id="course-assignments"><a class="header" href="#course-assignments">Course Assignments</a></h3>
<p>Over the 8 weeks, I also ask that every student attends 1 show and 1 open mic. See the show and open mic list for suggestions.</p>

<p>Great sets radiate the comedian's personality and ideas. The best punchlines hit not only because they're well-crafted, but because they simultaneously capture a comedian's unique sense of humor and worldview.</p>
<p>The next 7 lessons give guidelines and exercises to learn technical writing and sharp performance. Unforunately, these skills can sometimes pull the comedian away from talking about something they actually care about and find funny. Sometimes technique obfuscates who the comedian really is as a person, which renders the stand-up meaningless, or worse, unfunny.</p>
<p>Everything about stand-up has to bleed you. The more "you" that permeates every idea, word, pause... the harder the jokes will hit.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, I'd return to this question: "am I being myself up there?"</p>
<h2 id="write-what-you-care-about"><a class="header" href="#write-what-you-care-about">Write what you care about</a></h2>
<p>Making something funny is hard, but I'd advise against choosing topics or ideas SIMPLY because they seem easier to make funny.</p>
<p>Write about things what you care about (and remember, those things can be dumb and silly). Some comics will have a joke fall flat and remark that it was only for a few people in the room. While I'd say in most cases that joke was for no one in the room and was bad, you should think about what jokes what be just "for you?" What topics would you be so excited if a comic was talking about... that's the joke you should write.</p>
<p>See Gary Gulman for a whole set clearly springing from some minutiae about abbreviations that caught his eye.</p>

<p>When a comic is talking about something they care about, it is almost a lens into who they are. You probably never really know somebody until they are talking about something they're excited about.</p>
<h2 id="what-irritates"><a class="header" href="#what-irritates">What irritates?</a></h2>
<p>Does it feel hard to even come up with what you care about? Then write about what irritates you. Stand-up is a lot of the time just sophisticated complaining. And if something bothers you, it probably bothers a lot of people, so people will almost always be on board.</p>
<p>Check this Pat Burtscher set, it drips with hilarious negativity.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g36f3Rb5fM" target="_blank" >

</a>
<p>Here, Pat is complaining about deep societal rot, but you don't have to be as grand in scope. Find mundanity that bothers you, especially something that other people seem to not even notice. That reveals something about you.</p>
<h2 id="show-not-tell"><a class="header" href="#show-not-tell">Show, Not Tell</a></h2>
<p>Over the set, the comedian must explain who they are. My favorite sets are the ones who do so in the comedy equivalent of "showing, not telling." They don't start with a barrage of facts about where they grew up, what their parents were like, what their current job is... instead their subject matter, their logic, their dress, their cadence make it clear.</p>
<p>Dusty Slay, a comic largely unknown when they debuted on the Tonight Show, nails this.</p>

</a>
<p>Sharp, concise sets take advantage of the fact that audiences have assumptions based on their first impression of a comedian. If certain assumptions are correct, you can leave them unsaid and get to the point. If the assumptions are incorrect, you can then subvert these for a joke. But try and learn what the audience is assuming about you, it might not always perfectly line up with what you're trying to project.</p>
<h2 id="conversational"><a class="header" href="#conversational">Conversational</a></h2>
<p>Great sets feel like conversations. The nice part is everyone has their own way of being conversational. Find how you like to have conversations with your friends... do you ramble through a story, do you mostly remain silent but hop in with witty lines, do you hold court explaining an idea?</p>
<p>Do that on stage.</p>
<p>Jo Firestone has a style that reminds me of a friend who instantly becomes self-conscious that they're leading the conversation, and is dying for someone else to hop in. Somehow, you can make that work in stand-up.</p>

<p>Set-up, Punchline, Tag... this is the grammar of stand-up comedy. In the same way every sentence is just some variations of subject, verb, object (or something like this maybe), most jokes can distilled down to the above structure.</p>
<p>A punchline is where the laugh is supposed to happen.</p>
<p>The set-up is everything that comes before the punchline.</p>
<p>A tag is extra laugh lines that build on the punchline.</p>
<p>Most jokes go set-up, punchline, and an optional tag... I wouldn't worry too much about great jokes that don't fit this structure. At least for this lesson, and likely for the first few years of your career, I think its useful for every single joke to adhere this structure.</p>
<p>Violating this structure takes both an equal amount of mastery and goodwill by an audience, neither of which you likely have when starting.</p>
<p>Lets explore this structure by looking at a few types of jokes that fit quite nicely into this structure.</p>
<h2 id="the-misdirect"><a class="header" href="#the-misdirect">The Misdirect</a></h2>
<p>To me, the bread and butter joke is the misdirect. These jokes fit very nicely into the set-up, punchline, tag structure. The set-up creates an expectation. The punchline violates it. A better explanation is just to watch this Dan Mintz joke.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCaFg6iy3wE" target="_blank" >
  <video width="100%" height="auto" controls loop>
    <source src="./media/mintzcut.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</a>
<p>Key to hard misdirect jokes are simple set-ups... these sometimes are beginning of stories, phrases, starts of conversations that you maybe have heard in your life already... you already know, or think you know, where the next sentence is going. This allows the violation of that expectation, or the punchline, to work.</p>
<p>Mintz, along with other one liner comics (check out Zach Reinert for a modern take on this) relies on "hard" misdirects, which I'm using to refer to punchlines that can be fantastical and non-realistic, just anything that catches the audience off guard.</p>
<p>Watch Laurie Kilmartin for a masterclass on a more conversational style approach to this type of joke. A lot of her jokes in this set fit very nicely into the misdirect class, and its quite easy to identify the set-up, punchline, tag structure, but the jokes are generally in service of a larger story.</p>

<p>An oft-referenced format in stand-up, but nonetheless I would say effective. After any set-up, the comic lists 3 things. The first two creates a pattern, the last one subverts it.</p>

<h2 id="apply-the-same-logic-joke"><a class="header" href="#apply-the-same-logic-joke">"Apply the Same Logic" joke</a></h2>
<p>A little bit of a mouthful, but this "logic" joke is another very popular structure of joke that fits nicely into the setup/punchline/tag structure.</p>
<p>The set-up is usually in two parts. The first one is an anecdote, or a news article they read, or just any situation. The second part breaks down the logic that led to the cause and effect in that situation. The punchline then "applies the same logic" to something else.</p>
<p>Todd Barry I think is the master of these types of jokes. Apologies for the captions on this clip.</p>

<p>These jokes tend to be elevated when the anecdote feels somewhat ordinary, but actually sounding out the logic behind what happens reveals something strange. Sometimes these jokes fall flat because if the "logic" behind the original anecdote is already obvious, or already clearly flawed, then going through it feels pedestrian.</p>
<h3 id="the-analogy"><a class="header" href="#the-analogy">The Analogy</a></h3>
<p>The analogy is a concise subset of this type of a joke, and is a variation of the same structure.</p>
<p>The first part of the set-up is an initial anecdote or situation. However, instead of a second part that plainly spells out some logic, the second part of the set-up isnow an analogy, an alternate situation the comedian asserts is similar to the initial anecdote. In this type of joke, the punchline then is explaining the logic that is similar between the two situations.</p>
<p>Again, this is better explained through example.</p>

</a>
<p>The initial situation is asking a 20-something guy to put a condom on. The analogy, or another situation that Taylor says is similar, is a kid putting a halloween costume on. Note this gets a laugh --- in certain applications of this type of joke, the analogy is both the set-up and the punchline, if the logic that binds the two situations is immediately apparent. However, for the most part, there is a punchline right after the analogy that explains why they're similar (spells out the logic that is similar between the two situations). Here, Taylor's act-out of the kid clearly explains why these are similar.</p>

<h2 id="some-basics"><a class="header" href="#some-basics">Some basics</a></h2>
<p>We've gotten the sense of the structure behind jokes, lets be concrete about a few basic principles.</p>
<h3 id="put-the-punchline-at-the-end-of-the-sentence"><a class="header" href="#put-the-punchline-at-the-end-of-the-sentence">Put the punchline at the end of the sentence</a></h3>
<p>You want to pause when the audience is supposed to laugh. Thus, once you say the funny part, you don't want to step over the laughs while finishing the sentence. Put the funny part at the end of the sentence.</p>
<h3 id="telegraph-the-punchline"><a class="header" href="#telegraph-the-punchline">Telegraph the punchline</a></h3>
<p>The funny part should be obvious and quick. Unless this is your exact style, I'd avoid subtle jokes and slow burns.</p>
<h3 id="trim-unecesssary-set-up"><a class="header" href="#trim-unecesssary-set-up">Trim unecesssary set-up</a></h3>
<p>Every part of the set-up should be necessary for the punchline to work. Feel free to embellish to get to the point faster. "The other day" is much quicker than "4 years ago when I turned 22"</p>
<h3 id="avoid-explanation"><a class="header" href="#avoid-explanation">Avoid explanation</a></h3>
<p>Avoid having to explain what something is. If your joke references something very sppecific, can you substitute it with general that everyone alreayd knows? If you need to explain what something is, you probably need a laugh in the explanation to justify it.</p>
<h3 id="cut-lukewarm-tags"><a class="header" href="#cut-lukewarm-tags">Cut lukewarm tags</a></h3>
<p>Tags should add on to a punchline. Generally keep a tag if it gets a laugh comparable to the punchline. If a tag gets a much smaller laugh, it's probably not worth it. Tags can sometimespretty much restate the punchline, and that's okay if the punchline can justify an extra line to really wring the crowd. But generally, tags should build on the idea of the punchline, not just rephrase it.</p>
<h2 id="in-class-exercises-1"><a class="header" href="#in-class-exercises-1">In-class Exercises</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify in a joke you wrote the set-up, punchline, tags. Is there any part that doesn't seem to fit this description, and if so, is it necessary for the joke? Is there anytime the traditional ordering of set-up-&gt;punchline-&gt;tag doesn't quite fit in your joke, and if so, should it be rearranged?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take the set-up in one of your jokes... and write a new punchline. If possible, use the classes of jokes described above. If a new punchline doesn't really work for your joke, you can start from scratch :).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some set-ups are easier as anecdotes. Turn the set-up of one of your jokes into a made-up anecdote.</p>

<h2 id="for-the-one-liners"><a class="header" href="#for-the-one-liners">For the one-liners</a></h2>
<p>Write 3 set-ups which create some sort of expectation.</p>
<p>For instance, A potential one is "I'm trying to quit sugar this year." There's the assumption that you're trying to quit for health reasons, or that the sugar you eat is from normal sweet foods like candy. These can potentially be subverted.</p>
<h3 id="for-the-hot-takes"><a class="header" href="#for-the-hot-takes">For the hot takes</a></h3>
<p>Play Devil's Advocate to a couple popular opinions now. Write some ideas how you can (comedically) justify your view.</p>
<p>For instance, I don't think everyone should go to therapy is a potential Devils' Advocate take.</p>
<h3 id="for-the-storytellers"><a class="header" href="#for-the-storytellers">For the storytellers</a></h3>
<p>When telling a story, embellishment, omission, and exaggeration are key to fit everyday life into the structure of stand-up. Take a story you think is funny, and rearrange the events to better fit the set-up/punchline structure.</p>
<h3 id="for-the-observationalists"><a class="header" href="#for-the-observationalists">For the observationalists</a></h3>
<p>Many great observational jokes show how something that seems normal is weird when you describe exactly what is happening. Try and find a normal, everyday event that is suddenly very odd when you spell out what is going on.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="move-the-mic-stand-out-of-the-way"><a class="header" href="#move-the-mic-stand-out-of-the-way">Move the Mic Stand Out of the Way</a></h1>
<p>Early on in your career, audiences are looking for any excuse to stop listening. Sometimes, not moving the mic stand out of the way before starting your first joke is enough for people to think you're an amateur. Stand-up is hard enough... and looking like you know what you're doing is necessary to even have a chance of getting laughs.</p>
<p>We'll focus on how to open strong. This lesson focuses on choosing a strong opening joke, and also covers some of the absolute basics of how to go from being introduced to actually performing that opening joke.</p>
<h2 id="wait-until-theyre-listening"><a class="header" href="#wait-until-theyre-listening">Wait Until They're Listening</a></h2>
<p>No matter how good your opening joke is, if people aren't listening they're not going to laugh. Many times in-between comics going up is the only time audience members get to shuffle to the bathroom, say a joke to their friend, check their phone. You need to wait till people are ready before you start. For most crowds, this just means take your time before you start. Move the mic stand out of the way, adjust the stool, say hi... and then start.</p>
<p>Watch how Bargatze starts his sets. The awkwardness is a clever way to give the time necessary for people to start listening.</p>

<h2 id="call-me-ishmael"><a class="header" href="#call-me-ishmael">Call Me Ishmael</a></h2>
<p>Start with a joke that is both punchy (gets a clear laugh) and introduces who you are. Moby Dick nails this.</p>
<p>If you are one of those people with a name, a joke about your name works well.</p>

<p>Another popular way that easily checks both these boxes is a joke that captures how you look. Lets look at Paige Weldon for a masterclass.</p>

<p>Note that you don't have to address the lowest stereotypes. I'd say Paige's opening joke isn't rooted in simple assumptions, but more captures the essence of her look. These elevate your set early on, and help you break out of any simple jokes about stereotypes.</p>
<h3 id="ishmaels-hot-take"><a class="header" href="#ishmaels-hot-take">Ishmael's Hot Take</a></h3>
<p>Not interested in addressing your name or appearance? Same. A joke that captures your worldview works just as well in making the audience understand who you are.</p>

<h3 id="open-punchy"><a class="header" href="#open-punchy">Open punchy</a></h3>
<p>Early on, the audience isn't sure if you're funny, and has less patience for long set-ups. Open with "punchy" jokes, or jokes that have fewer words before it gets to the laugh. The longer your first set-up, the more the audience gets worried they're listening to someone rambling.</p>
<h3 id="open-clean"><a class="header" href="#open-clean">Open clean</a></h3>
<p>Do you have dirty stuff? The audience will tolerate it more if they trust you. Win them over early with cleaner stuff, and use that goodwill to get to your grosser stuff.</p>
<h3 id="say-hi"><a class="header" href="#say-hi">Say Hi</a></h3>
<p>Usually worth it to say hi and introduce yourself --- see the first point about making sure people are listening.</p>
<h2 id="and-the-rest-of-the-set"><a class="header" href="#and-the-rest-of-the-set">And the rest of the set?</a></h2>
<p>I listed a lot of nice guidelines for your opener. For the rest of the set, there's not many rules. Here's the most important things.</p>
<h3 id="end-on-time"><a class="header" href="#end-on-time">End on Time</a></h3>
<p>A comedy adage I've heard is to always end your set with your best joke, deemed "the closer." However, when starting out, you're frequently working with really short set times. You don't want to be in a position where you run out of time with your best joke.</p>
<p>So generally, I'd suggest front loading your best things near the front, and making sure you have quick ones to end the set in a pinch if the light comes earlier than you expect.</p>
<h3 id="the-light"><a class="header" href="#the-light">The Light?</a></h3>
<p>The host will shine a light at you when you have one minute (or sometimes two minutes) left in your set. First, don't go over. Second, acknowledge the light with a head nod, that way, the host doesn't think you missed it and repeatedly flash the light at you. Third, don't go over.</p>
<h3 id="you-dont-need-transitions-between-jokes"><a class="header" href="#you-dont-need-transitions-between-jokes">You Don't Need Transitions Between Jokes</a></h3>
<p>In most forms of writing, clean, flowing transitions between ideas is at the core of good writing. This does not apply to stand-up. Finishing a joke, pausing, and then starting your next joke is a perfectly fine segue 99% of the time.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TM7XIbRKZE" target="_blank" >
  <video width="100%" height="auto" controls loop>
    <source src="./media/roywoodjr.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</a>
<p>Roy Wood Jr. finishes off a 3 min political joke, and then hops into a joke about street fighter... and the only transition he does is a little pause.</p>
<h3 id="cohesion-in-logic-not-necessarily-subject-matter"><a class="header" href="#cohesion-in-logic-not-necessarily-subject-matter">Cohesion in logic, not necessarily subject matter</a></h3>
<p>The jokes that make-up your set do not need to fit together. You can talk about farts and politics in the same set. However, your "worldview" does have to be cohesive... it is jarring when your attitude in one joke is contradicted in a future joke. If you set-up your fart joke by saying that you're a dumb guy and don't like to have hot takes, it'll feel odd if you then transition into some hard hitting political jokes.</p>
<p>Generally, set cohesion is something that emerges naturally from the jokes you write --- in general, I wouldn't even think about this too much. If you're writing about things you care about (see Lesson 1), a cohesive worldview will naturally be shared among all the jokes.</p>
<p>This clip isn't really that representative of this, but been looking for an excuse to share some Martin Urbano:</p>

<p>If following the class faithfully, this week will be your first time performing stand-up. If all goes well, this lesson will be useless and you have my permission to spend the week gloating. However, and perhaps more likely, if it doesn't go as well as you fantasized about, this is the lesson for you.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we'll talk a little about bombing. Bombing, or not getting laughs, is an inevitable part of doing stand-up. In fact, nothing is more important in stand-up than bombing. It is an absolutely fundamental skill to know IF you bombed, and know how to try and not bomb next time.</p>
<h2 id="record-audio-and-not-video"><a class="header" href="#record-audio-and-not-video">Record Audio (and not video!)</a></h2>
<p>In order to know what did well and what bombed, you need to be able to listen back to your set without the adrenaline of being on stage. It is essential to <strong>record audio of your set</strong>, that way you can listen back later on to evaluate and revise.</p>
<p>Any voice memo app on your phone works great. Put it on the stool (and not in your pocket) to get clear audio. I use an app that auto-transcribes --- this can potentially be useful.</p>
<p>I'd actually recommend against recording video early on. Its annoying to set-up, and you generally want to be mostly focusing on your set before you go up.</p>
<h2 id="try-to-watch-other-sets"><a class="header" href="#try-to-watch-other-sets">Try To Watch Other Sets</a></h2>
<p>It's tempting to prepare the entire time you go up, but I'd try sitting back and watching other sets. For one, "bombing" is always in the context of how good the room is. Getting light laughter in a completely silent room might be considered killing. The opposite is true in a hot, easy crowd. You can only really gauge a room by watching other comics.</p>
<h2 id="dont-hide-the-bomb"><a class="header" href="#dont-hide-the-bomb">Don't Hide the Bomb</a></h2>
<p>There's a lot of tips and tricks to make a bad set seem less bad. These include talking through silence, jumping into the next joke when a punchline doesn't hit, being loud, etc.. My suggestion would be to pause you'd normally do for laughter, and if there isn't, take a breath, then continue on to the next joke.</p>
<h3 id="no-need-to-address-it"><a class="header" href="#no-need-to-address-it">No Need to Address It</a></h3>
<p>This is probably controvserial, but I don't think you should acknowledge a joke not hitting, at least at this stage. At the open mic level, most jokes aren't hitting, so it isn't the same elephant in the room as it is when bombing in front of a great show.</p>
<p>I think there's little tricks that can get nervous laughter during the bomb, but I'm not sure its really necessary. Again, I'd generally recommend letting the joke miss, take a breath, then continue on.</p>
<h2 id="bomb-because-it-wasnt-funny"><a class="header" href="#bomb-because-it-wasnt-funny">Bomb BECAUSE it wasn't funny</a></h2>
<p>Bombing is part of stand-up, but you should bomb because a joke wasn't funny. A lot of new comics bomb for other reasons that don't really teach them much... usually due to being ill-prepared for their set.</p>
<p>Here's a couple ways to bomb that have nothing to do with how funny you are, and how to avoid them.</p>
<h3 id="forgettingmessing-up-jokes"><a class="header" href="#forgettingmessing-up-jokes">Forgetting/messing up jokes</a></h3>
<p>Every comic messes up jokes and forgets lines/words to a certain extent, but you can greatly lower the percentage of this happening with preparation. Feel no qualms about bringing up a setlist/notebook/index card on stage if it helps ensure you don't forget jokes. I would highly suggest using written materials on paper instead of your phone --- I've seen so many comedians flounder around with screen locks on stage. I also don't think too much about "professionality," but I think most people agree it just looks a little nicer when its paper being glanced at instead of a phone.</p>
<p>Definitely reading too much off notes can hurt your delivery, but I think early on erring on the side of nailing what you written matters more. Over time, weaning off reliance on notes is probably useful, but I think its much more important not to forget lines early on.</p>
<h3 id="can-they-hear-and-understand-you"><a class="header" href="#can-they-hear-and-understand-you">Can They Hear And Understand You?</a></h3>
<p>The funniest joke will bomb if they can't hear you or understand you. Before your set, listen to the sound system when other comics are performing. Muddy, reverby sound is common of bars with shitty sound systems... these require you to talk exceptionally slow and clearly. Listen back to your set after to ensure you can understand yourself.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="editing"><a class="header" href="#editing">Editing</a></h1>
<p>Sometimes comedy feels like waiting for the universe to grant you a joke. You're in a car, your mind is wandering, and boom you have a fully formed joke just bestowed upon you.</p>
<p>You should seize these gifts, of course, but in order to not feel like comedy is just playing some cosmic lottery, you must also learn how to edit jokes that don't work, and punch-up jokes that sort of work.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we'll talk about editing, fixing, and punching-up jokes.</p>
<h2 id="writing-vs-editing"><a class="header" href="#writing-vs-editing">Writing vs Editing</a></h2>
<p>For me, writing new ideas is all about letting my brain run freely. I try to write freely, without filters, in a stream of conscious-like manner.</p>
<p>In contrast, I would say editing is very systematic, very concrete, and very goal-directed. Having clear goals when sitting down to work on a joke is necessary to have productive results.</p>
<h2 id="have-the-joke-in-front-of-you"><a class="header" href="#have-the-joke-in-front-of-you">Have the Joke In Front Of You</a></h2>
<p>You need something in front of you to edit. In order to work on a joke, you need either a written version of it or a taped recording of it in front of you. Read it or listen to it to start.</p>
<h2 id="you-need-good-sample-sizes"><a class="header" href="#you-need-good-sample-sizes">You Need Good Sample Sizes</a></h2>
<p>Its hard to know what works or doesn't work if you've never performed a joke, or only performd it once. Running jokes with the same wording multiple times (at different open mics) is necessary to get the statistical power needed to know which parts work, and which parts didn't work. Don't let a weird room make you completely revamp a joke that already might work.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-or-punching-up"><a class="header" href="#fixing-or-punching-up">Fixing or Punching-up?</a></h2>
<p>There's a big difference between getting something working, and improving something that already works. In the latter, you don't want to mess with the major beats, and instead cut things that take-away from the joke, and add in only that which sharpens in.</p>
<p>In the former, fixing a broken joke sometimes means completely reworking the joke. Here's a couple tips for getting a joke working.</p>
<h3 id="work-on-broken-jokes-that-youre-excited-about"><a class="header" href="#work-on-broken-jokes-that-youre-excited-about">Work on broken jokes that you're excited about</a></h3>
<p>In stand-up, usually your first pass at a joke is a pretty good attempt. If a joke completely doesn't work your first few times trying it, it'll likely be a lot of work to get it working. This doesn't mean don't work on jokes that don't work the first time, I'm just saying only work on it if you really like the idea or truly believe that it is promising.</p>

<p>Most of the times when a joke completely fails, it is not because they've all simultaneously deemed it unfunny. More often than not, they have no idea what you're talking about.</p>
<p>Start with if it is clear what you're getting at. Make sure there's no information you assumed people knew but they actually do not. Running ideas in conversation with friends/comics is a good way to get at this question of if you're just incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Revisit Week 2 ideas, and identify set-up and punchlines. Are these clearly separated? Is the punchline at the end? Is everything in the set-up necessary for the punchline to work?</p>

<p>If people understand the joke and you have a few punchlines, but the reception is still lukewarm, what do you do now? Here's some ideas on how to make tsomething funnier.</p>
<h3 id="go-bigger"><a class="header" href="#go-bigger">Go bigger</a></h3>
<p>Add hyperbole. Try going bigger, more fantastical, more rowdy, more dirty, more of whatever is the funny part of your joke. See how Maddie Wiener escalates how much she likes Ben Jerry by going big and dirty.</p>

<h3 id="go-smaller"><a class="header" href="#go-smaller">Go smaller</a></h3>
<p>Understatement can work in the same way as exaggeration. Sheng Wang frequently employs this by having a rapidly escalating set-up and then having a deadpan punchline where he responds in a relaxed, understated way. Note the decompression from the set-up ("they smash your balls multiple times") to the punchline ("I probably don't got it").</p>

<h3 id="flip-the-punchline-and-set-up"><a class="header" href="#flip-the-punchline-and-set-up">Flip the punchline and set-up</a></h3>
<p>It suprises me how often a joke can still make sense when you flip the punchline and the set-up. See this Ian Edwards joke, where the punchline reveals he never watched the Michael Jackson documentary. Here, this joke could have very easily been written such that in the set-up he references he never seen the Michael Jackson documentary, and thats why he can enjoy his music. Instead, he formats it cleverly about how big of a piece of shit you'd have to be to watch the documentary and enjoy MJs music, before revealing he never watched the documentary.</p>

<p>This is a general guide for someone wanting to perform stand-up tonight. We start in your house, we end back there way too late.</p>
<h1 id="picking-an-open-mic"><a class="header" href="#picking-an-open-mic">Picking an open mic</a></h1>
<p>Great, you want to do an open mic tonight. First, pick one out. For Chicago folks, an incomplete list is here[^1]. Each mic is different --- some are well-attended by non-comics, others by barely anyone. Depending on how sign-up works and how many comics attend, each has different amounts of waiting before you go up. Some mics suck, some are good, but mostly you have to go to em and decide for yourself what you prefer.</p>
<h1 id="open-mic-sign-ups"><a class="header" href="#open-mic-sign-ups">Open Mic sign-ups</a></h1>
<p>Here are the common ways open mics sign-up works.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>"Show up go up" usually means in-person sign ups at a predetermined time (most commonly half an hour before the actual start time). Reach out and ask if sign-up time isn't clearly indicated. People usually arrive earlier than the actual sign-up since there's almost always the implicit rule of sign-up in the order you got there. You kinda have to start going to figure out what time you should actually show up to get the spot you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Lottery" or "bucket" usually has you write your name on a slip of paper and throw it in a receptacle of some sort. Thus, its "random" order --- how long you arrived before sign-up doesn't affect your spot. There's many variations on this, so you have to go to a specific mic to see how its actually done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Pre-signups" or "booked mics," usually has some method of filling slots prior to sign-up, either through online sign-ups, submissions, etc. Usually for mics with limited number of slots.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="during-the-mic"><a class="header" href="#during-the-mic">During the mic</a></h1>
<p>Note whether there's any item minimum required for the mic. It's generally good practice if you can afford it to grab a drink of some sort to support the venue, a water and a dollar tip also absolves any guilt or sin if you're on a budget.</p>
<p>After signing up, I'd suggest taking a picture of the list. Its a little bothersome to lose track of when you are, and hosts can be miffy if you repeatedly ask to recheck the list.</p>
<p>I'd always suggest newer comics watching as much as they can stand. After performing, I'd always stay for at least one person after you. After that, support the comics after as much as makes sense for yourself.</p>

<p>Thank the host before you leave.</p>
