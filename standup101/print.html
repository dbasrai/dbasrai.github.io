<p>Hi, my name is Diya Basrai, I'm a Chicago-based comic. This is the online "textbook" accompanying the stand-up 101 course I'm teaching at Revival Theater. The course is best suited for someone who has never performed stand-up before, but perhaps could be useful for those who are experienced but untalented.</p>
<p>Overall, this textbook covers the material, in-class exercises, and at-home assignments given during the in-person course. While mainly useful for those taking the course, I have some hope there is some interesting ideas for any comic who stumbles across this link. I've also tried to add a little practical advice on how to navigate the local scene, some suggestions universal and others specific to Chicago.</p>
<h1 id="layout"><a class="header" href="#layout">Layout</a></h1>
<p>The numbered weeks correspond to each week's class in an 8-week class. The Basics page contains useful advice for new comics, such as terminology and guides for entering a scene. The Chicago Resources page contains useful links for Chicago comics.</p>

<h2 id="course-overview"><a class="header" href="#course-overview">Course Overview</a></h2>
<p>Lesson 1 is about being yourself.</p>
<p>Lesson 2 focuses on the principles of joke structure.</p>
<p>Lesson 3 focuses on set structure and performance basics.</p>
<p>Lesson 4 is the first WORKSHOP, where students will perform 2-3 minutes of jokes to each other and give feedback.</p>
<p>Lesson 5 focuses on editing and refining.</p>
<p>Lesson 6 is reserved for parent teacher conferences.</p>
<p>Lesson 7 is about finding your voice.</p>
<p>Lesson 8 is the second WORKSHOP, where students will perform 3-5 minutes of jokes to each other and give feedback.</p>
<h2 id="lesson-overview"><a class="header" href="#lesson-overview">Lesson Overview</a></h2>
<p>Each lesson, we'll start by having some people pitch some jokes they wrote over the past week.</p>
<p>Then, I'll go over the material of the week, albeit in a more discussion-based manner.</p>
<p>Peppered in throughout, we'll break into small groups and do some of the listed group exercises.</p>
<p><em>It is highly encouraged to read through the weeks write-up here prior to coming to class, and watch the embedded clips.</em></p>
<h2 id="assignments"><a class="header" href="#assignments">Assignments</a></h2>
<h3 id="weekly-assignments"><a class="header" href="#weekly-assignments">Weekly Assignments</a></h3>
<p>Students are asked to 1) Write one joke, and 2) Do one of the assigments listed at the end of the week's page.</p>
<h3 id="course-assignments"><a class="header" href="#course-assignments">Course Assignments</a></h3>
<p>Over the 8 weeks, I also ask that every student attends 1 show and 1 open mic. See the show and open mic list for suggestions.</p>

<p>Great sets radiate the comedian's personality and ideas. The best punchlines hit not only because they're well-crafted, but because they simultaneously perfectly capture a comedian's unique sense of humor and worldview. With just a few concise lines, the audience suddenly sees the world from the eyes of whoever is on stage... and this is what makes jokes hit hardest.</p>
<p>The next 7 lessons give guidelines and exercises to learn technical writing and sharp performance. Unforunately, these skills can sometimes pull the comedian away from talking about something they actually care about and find funny. Sometimes technique obfuscates who the comedian really is as a person, which renders the stand-up meaningless, or worse, unfunny.</p>
<p>Everything about stand-up has to bleed you. The more "you" that permeates every idea, word, pause... the harder the jokes will hit.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, I'd return to this question: "am I being myself up there?"</p>
<h2 id="write-what-you-care-about"><a class="header" href="#write-what-you-care-about">Write what you care about</a></h2>
<p>Making something funny is hard, but I'd advise against choosing topics or ideas SIMPLY because they seem easier to make funny.</p>
<p>Write about things what you care about (and remember, those things can be dumb and silly). Some comics will have a joke fall flat and remark that it was only for a few people in the room. While I'd say in most cases that joke was for no one in the room and was bad, you should think about what jokes what be just "for you?" What topics would you be so excited if a comic was talking about... that's the joke you should write.</p>
<p>See Gary Gulman for a whole set clearly springing from some minutiae about abbreviations that caught his eye.</p>

<p>When a comic is talking about something they care about, it is almost a lens into who they are. You probably never really know somebody until they are talking about something they're excited about.</p>
<h2 id="what-irritates"><a class="header" href="#what-irritates">What irritates?</a></h2>
<p>Does it feel hard to even come up with what you care about? Then write about what irritates you. Stand-up is a lot of the time just sophisticated complaining. And if something bothers you, it probably bothers a lot of people, so people will almost always be on board.</p>
<p>Check this Pat Burtscher set, it drips with hilarious negativity.</p>

</a>
<p>Here, Pat is complaining about deep societal rot, but you don't have to be as grand in scope. Find mundanity that bothers you, especially something that other people seem to not even notice. That reveals something about you.</p>
<h2 id="show-not-tell"><a class="header" href="#show-not-tell">Show, Not Tell</a></h2>
<p>Over the set, the comedian must explain who they are. My favorite sets are the ones who do so in the comedy equivalent of "showing, not telling." They don't start with a barrage of facts about where they grew up, what their parents were like, what their current job is... instead their subject matter, their logic, their dress, their cadence make it clear.</p>
<p>Dusty Slay, a comic largely unknown when they debuted on the Tonight Show, nails this.</p>

<p>Sharp, concise sets take advantage of the fact that audiences have assumptions based on their first impression of a comedian. If certain assumptions are correct, you can leave them unsaid and get to the point. If the assumptions are incorrect, you can then subvert these for a joke. But try and learn what the audience is assuming about you, it might not always perfectly line up with what you're trying to project.</p>
<h2 id="conversational"><a class="header" href="#conversational">Conversational</a></h2>
<p>Great sets feel like conversations. The nice part is everyone has their own way of being conversational. Find how you like to have conversations with your friends... do you ramble through a story, do you mostly remain silent but hop in with witty lines, do you hold court explaining an idea?</p>
<p>Do that on stage.</p>
<p>Jo Firestone has a style that reminds me of a friend who instantly becomes self-conscious that they're leading the conversation, and is dying for someone else to hop in. Somehow, you can make that work in stand-up.</p>

<p>Set-up, Punchline, Tag... this is the grammar of stand-up comedy. In the same way every sentence is just some variations of subject, verb, object (or something like this maybe), most jokes can distilled down to the above structure.</p>
<p>A punchline is where the laugh is supposed to happen.</p>
<p>The set-up is everything that comes before the punchline.</p>
<p>A tag is extra laugh lines that build on the punchline.</p>
<p>Most jokes go set-up, punchline, and an optional tag... I wouldn't worry too much about great jokes that don't fit this structure. At least for this lesson, and likely for the first few years of your career, I think its useful for every single joke to adhere this structure.</p>
<p>Violating this structure takes both an equal amount of mastery and goodwill by an audience, neither of which you likely have when starting.</p>
<p>Lets explore this structure by looking at a few types of jokes that fit quite nicely into this structure.</p>
<h2 id="the-misdirect"><a class="header" href="#the-misdirect">The Misdirect</a></h2>
<p>To me, the bread and butter joke is the misdirect. These jokes fit very nicely into the set-up, punchline, tag structure. The set-up creates an expectation. The punchline violates it. A better explanation is just to watch this Dan Mintz joke.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCaFg6iy3wE" target="_blank" >
  <video width="100%" height="auto" controls loop>
    <source src="./media/mintzcut.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video> 
</a>
<p>Key to hard misdirect jokes are simple set-ups... these sometimes are beginning of stories, phrases, starts of conversations that you maybe have heard in your life already... you already know, or think you know, where the next sentence is going. This allows the violation of that expectation, or the punchline, to work.</p>
<p>Mintz, along with other one liner comics (check out Zach Reinert for a modern take on this) relies on "hard" misdirects, which I'm using to refer to punchlines that can be fantastical and non-realistic, just anything that catches the audience off guard.</p>
<p>Watch Laurie Kilmartin for a masterclass on a more conversational style approach to this type of joke. A lot of her jokes in this set fit very nicely into the misdirect class, and its quite easy to identify the set-up, punchline, tag structure, but the jokes are generally in service of a larger story.</p>

<h2 id="apply-the-same-logic-joke"><a class="header" href="#apply-the-same-logic-joke">"Apply the Same Logic" joke</a></h2>
<p>A little bit of a mouthful, but this "logic" joke is another very popular structure of joke that fits nicely into the setup/punchline/tag structure.</p>
<p>The set-up is usually in two parts. The first one is an anecdote, or a news article they read, or just any situation. The second part breaks down the logic that led to the cause and effect in that situation. The punchline then "applies the same logic" to something else.</p>
<p>Todd Barry I think is the master of these types of jokes. Apologies for the captions on this clip.</p>

<p>Perhaps another way of illustrating this type of joke is this great Jon Dore bit both using this type of joke and somewhat poking fun of it.</p>

<p>These jokes tend to be elevated when the anecdote feels somewhat ordinary, but actually sounding out the logic behind what happens reveals something strange. Sometimes these jokes fall flat because if the "logic" behind the original anecdote is already obvious, or already clearly flawed, then going through it feels pedestrian.</p>
<h3 id="the-analogy"><a class="header" href="#the-analogy">The Analogy</a></h3>
<p>The analogy is a concise subset of this type of a joke, and is a variation of the same structure.</p>
<p>The first part of the set-up is an initial anecdote or situation. However, instead of a second part that plainly spells out some logic, the second part of the set-up isnow an analogy, an alternate situation the comedian asserts is similar to the initial anecdote. In this type of joke, the punchline then is explaining the logic that is similar between the two situations.</p>
<p>Again, this is better explained through example.</p>

<p>The initial situation is asking a 20-something guy to put a condom on. The analogy, or another situation that Taylor says is similar, is a kid putting a halloween costume on. Note this gets a laugh --- in certain applications of this type of joke, the analogy is both the set-up and the punchline, if the logic that binds the two situations is immediately apparent. However, for the most part, there is a punchline right after the analogy that explains why they're similar (spells out the logic that is similar between the two situations). Here, Taylor's act-out of the kid clearly explains why these are similar.</p>
<p>Another example...</p>

<p>This is a general guide for someone wanting to perform stand-up tonight. We start in your house, we end back there way too late.</p>
<h1 id="picking-an-open-mic"><a class="header" href="#picking-an-open-mic">Picking an open mic</a></h1>
<p>Great, you want to do an open mic tonight. First, pick one out. For Chicago folks, an incomplete list is here[^1]. Each mic is different --- some are well-attended by non-comics, others by barely anyone. Depending on how sign-up works and how many comics attend, each has different amounts of waiting before you go up. Some mics suck, some are good, but mostly you have to go to em and decide for yourself what you prefer.</p>
<h1 id="open-mic-sign-ups"><a class="header" href="#open-mic-sign-ups">Open Mic sign-ups</a></h1>
<p>Here are the common ways open mics sign-up works.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>"Show up go up" usually means in-person sign ups at a predetermined time (most commonly half an hour before the actual start time). Reach out and ask if sign-up time isn't clearly indicated. People usually arrive earlier than the actual sign-up since there's almost always the implicit rule of sign-up in the order you got there. You kinda have to start going to figure out what time you should actually show up to get the spot you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Lottery" or "bucket" usually has you write your name on a slip of paper and throw it in a receptacle of some sort. Thus, its "random" order --- how long you arrived before sign-up doesn't affect your spot. There's many variations on this, so you have to go to a specific mic to see how its actually done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Pre-signups" or "booked mics," usually has some method of filling slots prior to sign-up, either through online sign-ups, submissions, etc. Usually for mics with limited number of slots.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="during-the-mic"><a class="header" href="#during-the-mic">During the mic</a></h1>
<p>Note whether there's any item minimum required for the mic. It's generally good practice if you can afford it to grab a drink of some sort to support the venue, a water and a dollar tip also absolves any guilt or sin if you're on a budget.</p>
<p>After signing up, I'd suggest taking a picture of the list. Its a little bothersome to lose track of when you are, and hosts can be miffy if you repeatedly ask to recheck the list.</p>
<p>I'd always suggest newer comics watching as much as they can stand. After performing, I'd always stay for at least one person after you. After that, support the comics after as much as makes sense for yourself.</p>
<h1 id="after-the-mic"><a class="header" href="#after-the-mic">After the mic</a></h1>
<p>Thank the host before you leave.</p>

<p>Open mics and shows are quite transient, I would double check any info on this list.</p>
