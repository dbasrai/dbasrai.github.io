# Ambient Sound

In this class, I wanted to make several key adjustments in order to avoid typical tropes that student filmmakers fall into. Namely, I wanted there to not be sound cutting when I cut to a different video shot. 

I looked up some basic video tutorials, and this is how I ended up avoiding this: First, I always recorded ambient with my onboard camera and with my aux mic. First, I was tempted just to overlay this baseline audio over the entire video This seems like an easy solution, but the main problem is you essentially double ambience if you leave it throughout like this: beacuse you get this baseline ambience, but also the ambience from the video clip themselves.

Thus, I eventually began cutting out the baseline ambience whenever unecessary, and instead just used it to blend two video clips together. I would cut the end sound and the beginning sound of two adjacent video clips, and then overlay the ambience over those two sections with the end and beginning sound missing. Then I would fade in the sound and fade out the ambience at the same time to make it seamless. In this way, There wouldn't be that harsh clipping sound whenever you cut from one video clip to the next.

Furthermore, I also utilized ambient sound a lot because I did a lot of sound in post. Here, I would just completely chop the video sound, and instead just overlay the baseline ambient sound and sound effects I recorded in post .
