# Welcome!

Hi, my name is Diya Basrai, I'm a Chicago-based comic. This is the online "textbook" accompanying the stand-up 101 course I'm teaching at Revival Theater. 

The current dogma is that you learn stand-up by doing. The way to start is to just start writing and doing open mics, and that any formal instruction like a class is unecessary at best and a scam at worse. I mostly agree with this and I definitely think anyone interested in doing stand-up should start doing open mics asap. 

I think John Roy's guide is reasonably excellent primer on how to start writing a joke and think critically about your set. https://johnroycomic.tumblr.com/post/54132250195/my-complete-entirely-free-on-line-comedy-class.

However, I do think that there is some knowledge that can be passed on academically, and can help comics improve faster than just by rote doing. While the in-person course I'm teaching largely revolves around performing and receiving feedback, I've tried to make this online textbook be a little hub of some knowledge I personally think is useful. I've also tried to pepper in a lot of good examples and opinions. 

While the in-person course is best suited for someone who has never performed stand-up before and has ~$300, this textbook is a compilation of my thoughts, examples, and opinions accompanying each lesson that is hopefully interesting to comics of all levels.
