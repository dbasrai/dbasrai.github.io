# Move the Mic Stand Out of the Way

Early on in your career, audiences are looking for any excuse to stop listening. Sometimes, not moving the mic stand out of the way before starting your first joke is enough for people to think you're an amateur. Stand-up is hard enough... and looking like you know what you're doing is necessary to even have a chance of getting laughs.

We'll focus on how to open strong. This lesson focuses on choosing a strong opening joke, and also covers some of the absolute basics of how to go from being introduced to actually performing that opening joke.

## Wait Until They're Listening

No matter how good your opening joke is, if people aren't listening they're not going to laugh. Many times in-between comics going up is the only time audience members get to shuffle to the bathroom, say a joke to their friend, check their phone. You need to wait till people are ready before you start. For most crowds, this just means take your time before you start. Move the mic stand out of the way, adjust the stool, say hi... and then start.

Watch how Bargatze starts his sets. The awkwardness is a clever way to give the time necessary for people to start listening.

In a rowdier, less respectful crowd, you may have to instruct them to pay attention. 

See Dulce Sloan for a very direct approach to making sure people are paying attention.

## Call Me Ishmael 

Start with a joke that is both punchy (gets a clear laugh) and introduces who you are. Moby Dick nails this. 

If you are one of those people with a name, a joke about your name works well.

Another popular way that easily checks both these boxes is a joke that captures how you look. Lets look at Paige Weldon for a masterclass.

Note that you don't have to address the lowest stereotypes. I'd say Paige's opening joke isn't rooted in simple assumptions, but more captures the essence of her look. These elevate your set early on, and help you break out of any simple jokes about stereotypes.

### Ishmael's Hot Take

Not interested in addressing your name or appearance? Same. A joke that captures your worldview works just as well in making the audience understand who you are.

See Roy Wood Jr. for one of the sickest ways to open a special --- the following (audio-only) clip is from the very start of the album.

### Open punchy

Early on, the audience isn't sure if you're funny, and has less patience for long set-ups. Open with "punchy" jokes, or jokes that have fewer words before it gets to the laugh. The longer your first set-up, the more the audience gets worried they're listening to someone rambling. 

### Open clean

Do you have dirty stuff? The audience will tolerate it more if they trust you. Win them over early with cleaner stuff, and use that goodwill to get to your grosser stuff.

### Say Hi

Usually worth it to say hi and introduce yourself --- see the first point about making sure people are listening. 

## And the rest of the set?

I listed a lot of nice guidelines for your opener. For the rest of the set, there's not many rules. Here's the most important things. 

### End on Time

A comedy adage I've heard is to always end your set with your best joke, deemed "the closer." However, when starting out, you're frequently working with really short set times. You don't want to be in a position where you run out of time with your best joke.

So generally, I'd suggest front loading your best things near the front, and making sure you have quick ones to end the set in a pinch if the light comes earlier than you expect.

### The Light?

The host will shine a light at you when you have one minute (or sometimes two minutes) left in your set. First, don't go over. Second, acknowledge the light with a head nod, that way, the host doesn't think you missed it and repeatedly flash the light at you. Third, don't go over.  

### You Don't Need Transitions Between Jokes

In most forms of writing, clean, flowing transitions between ideas is at the core of good writing. This does not apply to stand-up. Finishing a joke, pausing, and then starting your next joke is a perfectly fine segue 99% of the time.

Roy Wood Jr. finishes off a 3 min political joke, and then hops into a joke about street fighter... and the only transition he does is a little pause.

### Cohesion in logic, not necessarily subject matter

The jokes that make-up your set do not need to fit together. You can talk about farts and politics in the same set. However, your "worldview" does have to be cohesive... it is jarring when your attitude in one joke is contradicted in a future joke. If you set-up your fart joke by saying that you're a dumb guy and don't like to have hot takes, it'll feel odd if you then transition into some hard hitting political jokes. 

Generally, set cohesion is something that emerges naturally from the jokes you write --- in general, I wouldn't even think about this too much. If you're writing about things you care about (see Lesson 1), a cohesive worldview will naturally be shared among all the jokes. 

This clip isn't really that representative of this, but been looking for an excuse to share some Martin Urbano:

### Say Bye

When you end your set, make it obvious you're ending your set. Say "that's all I got," or make a big wave, but make it explicit. 

## In-Class Assignments

1) I always suggest a little ritual as you get on stage, and doing the same thing each set. It doesn't have to be funny, just has to reflect YOU! Come up with one.

2) Choose an opening joke. Practice pretending to be introduced, and launching into it. 

## Assignments

### For people who look like something:

1) Write an I-look-like joke (or an I-know-what-you're-thinking joke), but avoiding using other humans as descriptors (don't say you look like if Brad Pitt and George Clooney had a baby). Come up with abstractions, rewferences to inaminate objects, aniimals, etc. See Paige Weldon's allergy joke above as an example.

### For the tight writers

1) Write a switch/misdirect on what would seem like a normal opening line... see this Gary Vider opener for an example:

  </video>
</a>

### For the ranters

1) Have a joke/rant/hot take in your set? Write an opening line where you sort of start in the middle of it, but its clear what you're talking about instantly. See the Roy Wood Jr Confederate Flag opener earlier for an example
