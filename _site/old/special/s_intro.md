hey, thanks for coming everyone.

i'm so happy to be filming this here at Whistle Stop Bar. i used to live here in san diego, would see so many incredibleshows here, i would see storytelling shows, live poetry, great standup, and when I was thinking of where to film my first comedy special, Whistle Stop kept sticking out this really artsy, experimental spot for live performance.

and so when I reached out asking if there was a free satuday in July I could potentailly film this here, Whistle Stop got back to me and was like, hey we're into this, but unfortunately on satudays... we do booty basement.

and when I reached out to whistle stop, I gave a similar schpeal, talking about how it was always my dream to do it here at whistle stop if they ever had a free staurday.

and whistle stop wrote back saying 'hey we're ito this, but on saturdays, we do booty basemenet. and we can't reschedule booty basement

if you don't know what booty basmenet is, its uh... not the storytelling show. 

theres usually stories told about booty basement, but not the story telling shopw. 

but here's the thing, they're right. and this is will be worse than booty basement. and i'm not being self-deprecating. like if my set goes perfect, you guys will have a worse time than the people at booty basement.

great stand-up is about equal in happiness to like a mediocre booty basement. 


becuse today im filming my special, but at booty asement its everyone's specail. 

and that's why i always laugh when either comics or comedy audiences take stand-up too seriously. because everyone here, we're all jsut the people not cool enough to be at booty basmene. i can spend years honing my craft, and i will still be less important than twerky thursdsays at a bar in pb.

so thanks so much for coming out and selling out both shows on a wednesday here. i don't want to be too heartfelt on camera so I don't destroy my hardman image. look if we want this on netflix, this has to be irreverent and boudnaryless. but thank you guys so much, means the world to me. 

ok y'all ready to do this?
