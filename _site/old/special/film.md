quentin tarantino? i hate that motherfucker. not because of the feet or the n word thing, actually that's my favorite part about him. 

i went to high school during the first generation of film kids.


i don't think kids should be able to take film studies. you should be allowed to follow your dream, but not when your dream is too specific. 

i dont like when peoples dreams are too specific. 

student film projects. are the worst thing ever. 

i hate quentin tarantino because  

i don't think film should be a college major. I don't think college majors should be something that someone fucking LOVES. like no one LOVES mechanical engineering, people like mechanical enginnering. 

you want to hear the secret about pulp fiction. non-chronological order. fuck you quentin tarantino. aboutx

they never learned their lesson

bill gates? i hate that guy. i hate his charity work. i hope 

following my dream?
