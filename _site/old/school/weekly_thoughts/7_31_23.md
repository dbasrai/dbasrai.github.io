continuing, exciting to be finally forced to understand a couple of basic but important topics i've put off. like probability, conditional probability, its weird how i've come quite far without quite having a good intuition for this stuff.

also continuing with work life balance. i think part of the reason im going to grad school is that the sheer amount of hours of work isn't the right way to think about productivity, and want to continue in this vein. 

I will continue this later.
