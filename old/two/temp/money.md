# money

I make just above minimum wage, and I'm bad at my job, so just above minimum wage is absolutely the correct amount. 90% of America is unpaid, and 9% is disitrubingly overpaid, and I might be the only guy in America who is paid exactly how much I deserve. 

Its cool to have a job. I get to enter through an authorized personnel only door. Before this, I've never been authorized personnel before, hell, I've never been personnel before. Before this job my highest security clearance was washing my hands in front of a sign that said Employees Must Wash Hands.  

Before this job, I didn't really know that authorized personnel could make minimum wage. I thought every single guy who scanned a badge to enter, you werer at least above the median income. I sort of realize there's minimum wage positions at every level of industry. Like whenever there is a presidental press conference, and there's all those guys flanking him. The people farthest to the left and right make 38,000 a year. The guy who walked through that eleementary school to tell Bush about 9/11 probably had two roommates. 

But no, I get to work, and they scan my fingerprint before I go and be bad at my job. It can't be good for the economy that I"m working. 

But no, at my work they scan my fingerprint to make sure its me, and then give me $3000 a month. Which is pretty good, accordingi to Google e$3000 is actually considered upper middle class in war torn sudan.

It's crazy that every person is supposed to have a job. more jobs than people. we need to get allowance from the government. eveyrone working to survive. people who have no itnrest working in something.
