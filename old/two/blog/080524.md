I have a skeleton for this special, and over this next 6ish months want to put it together to record it. I guess there's no real thematic concept, except I want to feel like... a tight 40, lots of callbacks, lots of throughlines, thematic ideas. I think the skeleton of material I have is well-suited for this. I think there's going to be a lot of blending bits together, I have bits that are thematically related, and wondering the idea of having one sort of eat the other. 

Also, want to start thinking a lot of the visual filming of it.
