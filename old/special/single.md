i didn't date in high school. and I will have my revenge.

clap your hands if you didn't date in high school ---- hey, we all still keep in touch with our english teachers.

we're underrepresented in media, you know... use who didn't date in high school. every show or movie about high schools, its just about the kids with very active dating lives. if you're a high schooler in a movie or show, you're more likely to hvae a supperpower than you are to be single. 

if you want to see the kids who aren't dating in high school, you have to look at the background of those shows. Like euphoria, right there is two hot people making out wiht each other. but if you look in the background, its 8 annoyed kids playing yugioh in the hallway.

I wish I dated in high school. i feel like dating in high school is an important developmental step. Because I'm 25 and single, and I feel like I'm not ready for these mid 20s dates. theyr'e too adult for me.. We went to a cooking class, and then went to go browse a used bookstore. 

I never wanted this horeshit. 

I still want a high school relatinoship, I don't want to date a high schooler, but I still want a high school relationship.

because even though I didn't date in high school, I think my feelings and crushes were the strongest they ever were. The most romantic candelit, perfect ambience dinner is nothing then getting to partner up with your curhs in English and then dsicuss.

She'd be like so what do you think the themes in of mice and men are. and I'd be like who... who do you like?
do you guys rembmer who do you like?

that was my go-to move in high school. I didn't have the courage to ask someone out, but I was willing to over the course of months get close to someone, eventually be alone with them, ask them who they like, and they would say someone else and I'd be devastated. but then I would repeat that 50 times a school year and that would be enough for me

I really think there was something romantic in high school when everybody knew everyobdy. l wish I dated when there were rumors about you. That's a high school specific thing, when there's rumors. If you're an adult, and there's a rumor about oyu... its bad. 

if you're an adult and there's a rumor, that's called an allegation.

but in high school, you get to announce your relationship on facebook. that might be the best itg ets. through the eons of human history, the best romance might get is in 2012, being a junior in high school, announcing your relationship on facebook, and getting 60 likes. do you guys remember what 60 likes in 2012? that's when 60 likes hits different.

because that was everybody on facebook in 2012. like, obama's inaguration in 2012 in 38 likes.

nowadays likes don't mean anything. The Yu-Gi-Oh hallway kids are now getting 3 digit likes on instagram

and by the way, that's not a glow-up, that's like inflation. just because he now got earrings and goes indoor rock climbing doesn't mean he's not a dweeb. he got 120 likes, that's just signs of a failing like economy.

but a pure uncut 2012 like? no bots, no fashion rands, just people you respect? when a like was so good you'd click on the profile of the person who liked it, just to savor it?

thanks so much everyboyd


i just turned 24, and I'm single, and I feel the clock ticking a little bit. I think I'm starting to run out of time. Before I refuse to be over 30 and single. and I have a good reason. the reason is if you're in your 30s and single, you're a little embarrassing to be around.


my advice is this, if you're over 30 and single, you should date someone, because you're making everyone around you feel a little weird. 

and i think if you're over 30 and single, that means something about you. that reflects on you in some way. I've met people in their 20s who are single, and its like you're great, it just might take some time for you to find the right person. everytime i've met someone in their 30s and single, its like oh I can see why no one loves you right now. 

and its your personality. its the inside that counts, and if you're over 30 and single, its th einside that's been rejected. you know all those things that make you you? that's what we hate.
