Continuing, this is the fun part where I think I'm brainstorming ways forward for my project. I'm starting to think about basic engineering ideas of dynamical systems, I think that idaes of impulse respone and stuff like that are reasonable ways to think about modeling, and likely combining with some RNN stuff in order to get interpreatble latents. 

Still extremely handwavey, I feel weirdly busy which is why I haven't spend too much time journaling here, but I do in the near future want to do these weekly thoughts much more seriously, and have them be an actual useful record insstead of just vomiting some thoughts onto a page. But at least I'm writing something which I think is the most useful.
