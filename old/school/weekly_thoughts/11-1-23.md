returning after a while, busy period. ended up dropping my signal processing class, and in the thick of learning surgeries, and putting starts to my project. My project DATA COLLECTION i think has settled on collecintg CFA/MThal data while using optogenetic pertubrations in either region. 

I do want to start thinking of some important principles that I want to govern my questions. some examples like thinking about how movement is generated, not represented. Constraints for skilled movement.
