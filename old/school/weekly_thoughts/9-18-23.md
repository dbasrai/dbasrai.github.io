Haven't updated this in a while, but I'm committed to getting into a good habit of journaling my thoughts here. I had just "wrapped up" some preliminary work on the initial dataset Mark and Sajishnu collected with the simultaneous opto stim stuff, and mostly just showed that there is a smaller range of weights that allows good fits with laser data. 

Now is the fun part of brainstorming experimental questions, thining about potential datasets to colelct, essentially thinking through my potential thesis project, thinking about my quals, etc. This is a fun time to read and think, and I want to make sure to take advantage of it.

To me there are clearly some sort of common thing between ideas of low-dimensional manifolds, output-potent vs output-null, wide range of good fit models, interconnectedness, etc. and this contrats things like CIRCUITS, MODULARITY. I want to think about potential frameworks that bridge concepts between this, and experimental/computational approaches that poentially can probe this.
