# Intro

This is a general guide for someone wanting to perform stand-up tonight. We start in your house, we end back there way too late.

# Picking an open mic

Great, you want to do an open mic tonight. First, pick one out. For Chicago folks, an incomplete list is here[^1]. Each mic is different --- some are well-attended by non-comics, others by barely anyone. Depending on how sign-up works and how many comics attend, each has different amounts of waiting before you go up. Some mics suck, some are good, but mostly you have to go to em and decide for yourself what you prefer.  

# Open Mic sign-ups

Here are the common ways open mics sign-up works. 

1) "Show up go up" usually means in-person sign ups at a predetermined time (most commonly half an hour before the actual start time). Reach out and ask if sign-up time isn't clearly indicated. People usually arrive earlier than the actual sign-up since there's almost always the implicit rule of sign-up in the order you got there. You kinda have to start going to figure out what time you should actually show up to get the spot you want. 

2) "Lottery" or "bucket" usually has you write your name on a slip of paper and throw it in a receptacle of some sort. Thus, its "random" order --- how long you arrived before sign-up doesn't affect your spot. There's many variations on this, so you have to go to a specific mic to see how its actually done. 

3) "Pre-signups" or "booked mics," usually has some method of filling slots prior to sign-up, either through online sign-ups, submissions, etc. Usually for mics with limited number of slots. 

# During the mic

Note whether there's any item minimum required for the mic. It's generally good practice if you can afford it to grab a drink of some sort to support the venue, a water and a dollar tip also absolves any guilt or sin if you're on a budget.

After signing up, I'd suggest taking a picture of the list. Its a little bothersome to lose track of when you are, and hosts can be miffy if you repeatedly ask to recheck the list. 

I'd always suggest newer comics watching as much as they can stand. After performing, I'd always stay for at least one person after you. After that, support the comics after as much as makes sense for yourself. 

# After the mic

Thank the host before you leave.
