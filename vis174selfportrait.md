# Self Portrait
[video](https://vimeo.com/251239946)

perhaps nothing quite captures an authentic portrait of ourself more than the algorithms that govern what we see on social media. 
simply taking a look at someone's facebook newsfeed captures a persons interests, hobbies, attitudes almost more candidly and accurately
than the person himself can actually tell you. furthermore, the way a person uses his computer is fascinating. watching someone just browse
the internet is uncomfortable and feels almost voyeuristic --- its seeing them at their least restrained and most vulnerable. 

in this video, i tried to capture my self portrait by attempting to get a candid screen recording of me using the internet --- i recorded my screen over 
a couple of days, trying to essentially forget that i was recording, and selected two minutes, mostly looking for me browsing in a banal
and uninteresting way. still, in these two minutes, it is  uncomfortable but also strangely interesting to watch me use facebook, 
check my homework, briefly log into twitter.
