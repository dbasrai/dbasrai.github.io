# Self Portrait
[video](https://vimeo.com/251239946)

perhaps nothing quite captures an authentic portrait of ourself more than the algorithms that govern what we see on social media. 
simply taking a look at someone's facebook newsfeed captures a persons interests, hobbies, attitudes almost more candidly and accurately
than the person himself can actually tell you. furthermore, the way a person uses his computer is fascinating. watching someone just browse the internet is uncomfortable and feels almost voyeuristic --- its seeing them at their least restrained and most vulnerable. specifically, this video was inspired by sitting in lecture and just watching the person use their laptop in front of me, i couldn't stop watching yet it felt wrong to keep looking. 

I was also somewhat inspired by the typical tropes of professors accidentally leaving their screen on when doing something personal. While I didn't quite venture into this super embarrassing category, its pretty fascinating watching somewhat completely accidentally put their private life in fron of everyone.

in this video, i tried to capture my self portrait by attempting to get a candid screen recording of me using the internet --- i recorded my screen over a couple of days, trying to essentially forget that i was recording, and selected two minutes, mostly looking for me browsing in a banal and uninteresting way. still, in these two minutes, it is  uncomfortable but also i feel strangely compelling to watch me use facebook, check my homework, briefly log into twitter. 

Since this video ended up being somewhat experimental, there wasn't that much 'intention' put into it aside from formulating the concept. The most I had to do was essentially forget that this was something I was doing; it was very tempting to start hamming it up when I was looking at my computer and be melodramatic in order to get a good 2 minutes.

I was worried I would have to do an insane amount of trawling to find a 2 minutes that was able to capture the idea I was going for, but I found the minutes extremely fast. It was perfect because it started with me opening chrome and 2 minutes later me closing chrome, and it showed me going through various social medias.

It also ended up being kinda funny? I guess its so strange watching someone in their most private that seeing me do things that everybody does becomes weirdly humorous. 

It was sucessful overall, but for future projects I'm less interested in doing something experimental, mostly because I want to improve at all the fundamental and technical aspects of storytelling, and making something experimental as I did in this project has the potential of allowing me to skip necessary filmic techniques.
