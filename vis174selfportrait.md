# Self Portrait
[video](https://vimeo.com/251239946)

perhaps nothing quite captures an authentic portrait of ourself more than the algorithms that govern what we see on social media. 
simply taking a look at someone's facebook newsfeed captures a persons interests, hobbies, attitudes almost more candidly and accurately
than the person himself can actually tell you. furthermore, the way a person uses his computer is fascinating. watching someone just browse
the internet is uncomfortable and feels almost voyeuristic --- its seeing them at their least restrained and most vulnerable. specifically, this video was inspired by sitting in lecture and just watching the person use their laptop in front of me, i couldn't stop watching yet it felt wrong to keep looking. 

in this video, i tried to capture my self portrait by attempting to get a candid screen recording of me using the internet --- i recorded my screen over 
a couple of days, trying to essentially forget that i was recording, and selected two minutes, mostly looking for me browsing in a banal
and uninteresting way. still, in these two minutes, it is  uncomfortable but also i feel strangely compelling to watch me use facebook, 
check my homework, briefly log into twitter.
