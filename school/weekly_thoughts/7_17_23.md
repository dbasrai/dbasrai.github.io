# monday, 7/17, im downtown

meant to do this weekly on fridays but for some reason have absolutely not done it at all. but hopefully starting now. 

enjoying the start --- im doing some modeling of the interaction between M1 and M2 during brief inactivation pulses in M1. nice bit of computational work, and a nice way for me to start learning some basics about modeling and dynamical systems. 

I definitely feel like im learning a lot of background information, but I do think I want to spend the time to actually read and learn from some papers. perhaps too many scrolling through abstracts. i do think talks in general are really useful and I'm glad i'm going through a lot of those.

phd work feels like the important thing is to do steady work, to avoid doing nothing and then spurts of work. i believe. and also to just trust that i'm moving forward at the right pace, and not feeling guilty when things are slow and not feeling overly proud when things move fast. i think this is also a good life skill --- most fo the time that thigns go well and feel easy its cuz you got a lil lucky, and most of the times things are failing are because you are a lil uncluky. i think..
