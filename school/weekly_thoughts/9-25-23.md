continuing to think hard about projects. Without becoing too method foucse,d I think the important thing is to consider questions that we are well equipped to try to answer. I think the real power is we can record multi-region on a synaptic timescale, we have an ethologically relevant behavior that doesn't require much training, and lastly we have opto pertubations, which might be tricky to use on an interventionist scale but can be esasily used to understand constraints on downstream patterns of activity.
