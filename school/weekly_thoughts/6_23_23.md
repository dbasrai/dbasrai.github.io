today is friday, and just finishing my first week after joining Andrew Miri and Josh Glaser's labs. I'm excited about these next ~5 or so years, and I think at least at this starting point the goal is to be organized, reflective, and start with high-level thoughts/questions/goals. Really think about what I don't have a clear understanding of, and make some plans to spend some time on these things. I also want to get in the habit of reading a lot THROUGHOUT my PhD, but especially in these early years when I don't really have many deadlines.
