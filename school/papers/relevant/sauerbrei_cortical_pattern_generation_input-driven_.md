## 3 hypothesis of cortical patterns
Cortical patterns drive movement. The question is what controls these patterns. Three guesses. 1) External input sets motor cortex to a initial state, and then the spring is released, and then it evolves without caring about external input too much. 2) Externl input is constantly fed into motor cortex, in order to drive pattern sin the right direction. 3) External input is constantly fed in, but there doesn't have to be a termporal pattern. (this third hyptohesis is somehwat tacked in to deal with results)

## hyptoehsis 1 doesn't seem right, shown by cortical silencing
cortical silencing blocks reach, but when the silencing is release, the reach occurs quickly. or something like this. bottom line, if hypothesis 1 is true, they expected some reaction time for the cortical dynamics to be restored to the correct initial condition (imagine silencing is pushing the spring, then once you releas it, you need to pull the spring). But this doesn't seem that likel.y, 

## hyptohesis 2 seems right, by cortical silenicng (creating the same initial state), and thend oing thalamic inactvation. 
they silenced to bring cortex to same initial state, and then sometimes silenced thalamus. Think about thalamus as injecting some input into cortex. When we silence thalamus, it blocks reach. When we release thalamus, it allows reach. Thus, even if the initial state is correct, we need proper input from thalamus to coordinate a motor action.

## we need temporally precise input, AND local dynamics in order to create the correct movement patterns.
modulating frequency of thalamic pertubations affects the cortical dynamics, suggesting the temporal pattern matters. Finally, using some statistics to see whether cortex purely reflects thalamic inputs OR cortical local circuitry shows that its a combo of both.
