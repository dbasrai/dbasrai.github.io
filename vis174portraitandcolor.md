# Portrait and Color

[video](https://youtu.be/M2ZaTzN19Ws)

At first, I wanted to be a bit more ambitious with this video in regards to the production aspect: I wanted some set design, a location that was not my house, costumes, and more actors --- I had this vague idea of a person being in hell that was mostly someone just being a dick to him.

However, due to mishaps and poor planning, I ended uop having to scrap the idea and instead settled on an idea that had the premise of being a parody of voice overs. I also loved the visual way that chess pieces look in regard to color and I also looked the auditory clacks of moving the pieces, so I combined this voice over premise with this chess grandmaster. The voice over was probably inspired by a commercial I saw called "Learn to Play Chess with Grandmaster Mesgan Amanov," which just had a melodramatic guy talking about chess as if it wasn't just a game. I also looked at some images of 'Searching for Bobby Fischer' for other ideas on how to use chess imagery.

The chess part ended up looking good. At first I wanted to actually play an actual game multiple times, film it with different angles, and intersperse it in such a way that it would make sense to players who played chess, but I realized that that woas much more work, so I just played randomish moves and filmed em out of sequence. Since the cuts were so fast you can't quite see that the game is continuous and pieces jump around, but if I had more time I would have invested effort into this small detail just to make myself happy.

The second half outside of the chess game is what I consider well-written, but not very interestingly filmed. I've been doing closeups with a 50mm for a little bit now, and this was more along the same lines. I just track with my face, and although I think it fits teh voice over, its just not a very interesting shot

The gag over closing the door worked out well, but visually I didn't account for a closed bathroom door vs an unclosed one and thus the bathroom shot had a lot of grain, which is something I would want to fix next time. 

The ending joke of yelling didn't quite work out the way I want to, nor did the shots of stubbing the toe or his face in pain. I'm not quite sure how I would re-work them; I think the joke itself just isn't that funny.

Overall, I think it was funny and I like the visuals of the chess game, but in the next video I want to be more ambituous with all the mise-en-scene aspects; the camerawork, the production, set design, costumes, etc.
